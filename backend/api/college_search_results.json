    "body": "I got into a PhD in Political Science at Kent State University. This was the only PhD program I got accepted into this cycle and I was absolutely overjoyed - it was my top choice. However, I was told that graduate funding for the department was cut completely because of Trump. The tuition is 20k a year and there’s no other chance of scholarships. I can’t go.\n\nI have been crushed by this. I hate Donald Trump and the fact that he has led this to happen to myself and so many others who worked so hard toward the dream of getting a PhD. Obviously there are more pressing things happening at this moment in time, and people are being affected in ways far greater than me by his administration, but good god this hurts. \n\nLuckily I was accepted into colleges abroad for MA programs, and I will be pursuing one of those options. I think it’ll be nice to get away from the country for a while and be able to get an education that I can actually afford, but it still sucks that I have to go through another PhD cycle in a few years despite having been successful in this one.\n\n\nUPDATE AND CLARIFICATION: \nThank you all for your comments! I’m going to put some clarification here. \n- I’m from the US and got my undergraduate degree here\n- Loans are an option but would put me at around or over $160k, which I don’t find to be feasible for the work I want to do\n\nNow for my update! This morning I was notified of acceptance into an MA where I would spend a year in Ireland and a year in Germany, with the total cost of the program being €7,000 after a small scholarship. This has been my most sought after alternative to a PhD, so I think I’m going to take it! Especially seeing as €3,500 a year is way better than $20,000. I’m still extremely bummed about the PhD because getting one is my ultimate goal in my education, and it hurts that something I worked so hard for has been dismantled by Trump because of his disdain for DEIA. However, maybe this a sign that the US just isn’t the place for me and my education right now. I hope things change and that I can come back to complete a PhD after my MA. If they don’t, at least there are great programs abroad :)\n"

    "body": "Just a couple of months ago, I was so happy and proud of myself. I had received three offers from excellent programs for a PhD in Chemistry. I did my visitation weekends, everything looked promising, and I had made my decision to attend Columbia University, not just because it’s a great program, but because one of the faculty there was just as excited about me as I was about them. Additionally, I would be moving closer to my family, and we were all excited about everything being perfect. Cut to today, and nearly everything has blown up in my face. Thanks to the funding cuts and the deliberate targeting of Columbia by the Trump administration, the professor I was supposed to join just let me know last week she may be losing several major grants and can’t say for certain that she’ll be able to fund me past my first year of PhD. I reached out to faculty at the other institutions I received offers from, and it’s the same story across the board. My offers stand, I’m welcome to come, but securing a lab position is going to be hard because professors are struggling to support the students they already have. I can defer for a year at two out of three of the universities, but there’s no guarantee it’ll get better in a year. It may get worse. I’ve been told by some faculty that I should consider taking a few years off and working in industry in the meantime, as if there isn’t also a severe shortage of jobs which is about to get worse considering the number of folks in academia losing their positions.\n\nI know I’m not alone in this, people everywhere are feeling this pressure, but I’m so tired of grieving for science. I’m actually getting quite pissed off. To the point that it’s on sight the second I hear anyone in my life say anything remotely political regarding science, medicine, or education. I’m defensive all the time and it’s exhausting, but this political climate is literally ruining my life and I don’t feel like being kind or patient with people anymore. I don’t want to live my life this way, but I’m so over having to take two steps forward and one step back every time I make progress in my life. I’m not giving up, I’m already in my mid-30s and I have put way too much into this career, but just once - JUST ONCE - I need it to not be an uphill battle to do the right thing.\n\nOn the bright side, between surviving undergrad during a pandemic and getting a PhD in this dystopian nightmare, I can safely say that this generation of academics is going to be tough as nails. Not that we need anymore character building arcs.\n\n\n*************************************************\nETA some updates and clarifications for people who are confused by this situation: \n\n1) Yes, Columbia has a massive multibillion dollar endowment. However, it largely can’t be touched because endowments are usually tied up in resources like real estate and land, and even if it was liquidated is only allowed to be used in specific ways. It’s not like dipping into a savings account like a rainy day. I don’t know the finer points of university financials myself, but from everything I’ve read, you can’t expect it to be able to quickly cash in on that endowment because of various legal constraints. \n\n2) A scientific PhD is a 5 year commitment to completing continuous research with funding. This funding does not come from me. There is nothing I can do personally to raise money. This isn’t the same as an undergraduate degree where you just pay your tuition and you get to stay. Scientific research comes from grant funding. Running a lab costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions. I can’t just get a scholarship and be fine. It’s my research, not just me, that must be funded. If my lab does not have funding to support my project, it’s over. I get sent home and have to reapply for other programs somewhere else. There is no such thing as going for a year, then coming back a few years later when this blows over. I will have to start over from the beginning, and I don’t know if you know this, but graduate level work is HARD. It’s not something you want to keep doing over and over indefinitely. There may be options for transferring to a different lab, but that also comes with serious ramifications, such as having to start a multi year project over. \n\n3) Yes, Columbia is a hot bed for political troubles. Despite everything, I believe that Columbia is the best place for me because it has the project and faculty that I specifically want to work with. It is something I have had to consider, as well as all the challenges of living in NYC, but in the end, there is no escaping political unrest at this time. The current administration has made all of science and academia political. There isn’t a single institution that I have applied to or received an offer from that isn’t feeling extreme political and financial pressure at this point in time. I believe that these institutions and faculty are doing their best to protect their students and the future of research from a corrupt and reactionary political regime. They were served federal warrants and are being given ultimatums in order to restore critical funding. It’s not as easy as “they should stand up to the orange man!” They still have to comply with federal laws. You should be mad at government enacting these injustices, not the institutions being attacked. You might disagree. We’ll have to agree to disagree. I have too much on my plate to worry about your opinions on the matter. \n\n4) After talking to several people close to me and a few of my mentors, I believe I will still choose to go to Columbia regardless of the uncertainty. I don’t know if I’ll ever get an opportunity like this again in my life, and I think one year guaranteed funding there, learning and researching alongside some of the best scientists in my chosen field, is still better than deferring for a year and trying to find work in an oversaturated job market. I don’t know if I could forgive myself for giving up now when I’m so close to my dream. And who knows? It might work itself out in the meantime. \n\n5) I am still mad. Not at any faculty or institution for their honesty or doing what they have to do to survive in this climate, but at the political situation itself, the demonization of science and education, and the injustice of this administration trying to bully us into submission by attacking and targeting students and research. This will continue to be a hot button issue with me until it stops. The damage being done this year will ripple through upcoming years, and the fact that these deleterious policies are being applauded by goons who have no understanding of what they are cheering on will always play out in mind as I pursue my career in academia. I wonder if I’ll ever not be mad. "

    "score": 2095,
    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1h0vhlq/in_the_past_three_days_ive_reviewed_over_100/",
    "body": "I recently conducted reviews of over 100 University of California essay drafts from my students, Redditors, and followers on social media. It was the first time in a while that I’ve reviewed such a high volume, and my findings were quite interesting. Students from the United States, Europe, East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and South America shared their essays with me. But even among this diverse cohort, I noticed some striking similarities in their essays.\n\nIn the past I’ve praised ChatGPT’s writing ability, especially for college admission essays. But it has a limited conception of what makes for a good essay, and with an uncreative prompt, it tends to make a “safe” choice, which is often clichéd. As I frequently emphasize, context is important. Your essays do not exist in a vacuum, but among the hundreds of thousands or even millions of essays out there. That’s why having a “good” essay is not enough. \n\nGenerative AI works by training on vast amounts of data. When prompted, it will make use of that training by predicting what would fit the prompt. It is by definition answering the way many have answered before. Every GPT comes with biases from its dataset, and ChatGPT (and Claude) have their own. \n\nI’ve been aware of some of them (unique punctuation, mutiple endings) for a while, but the other things are most recent discoveries. \n\nHere are what I consider the seven biggest hallmarks of ChatGPT:\n\n## 1. Vocabulary\n\nI'm not going to go into much here, as a lot has been written about this. There are certain words like “delve” and “tapestry” that are far more common in ChatGPT-written essays. But vocabulary as a telltale sign is also context-dependent. Based on my experience working with certain student populations (particularly students from India), I've been seeing words appear that a particular group would *never* use. \n\n## 2. Extended metaphor\n\nThis is an example of something already fairly common in human-authored college essays, but which ChatGPT uses in a limited number of ways.\n\nI want to offer some perspective: it's mind-blowing that ChatGPT can understand and generate sensical metaphors. It's one of the most significant achievements in AI to date. But the metaphors it uses are usually not very original. Common ones include:\n\n* Weaving (especially the aforementioned tapestry)\n\n* Cooking (all the ingredients with their own unique flavors being mixed with care coming together to create something delicious)\n\n* Painting (so many colors!)\n\n* Dance (who doesn’t love graceful coordination? Animals do it too!)\n\n* Music (it has a clear preference for classical symphonies. It's never ska, reggaeton, or arena rock!)\n\n## 3. Punctuation\n\nChatGPT has some idiosyncratic default punctuation behaviors. For example, it uses straight quotation marks for quotes and straight apostrophes for contractions, but curly apostrophes for possessives. It also defaults to em dashes—like this—which are not widely taught in high schools. Students used to use hyphens or en dashes – like this – but this year I'm seeing almost exclusively em dashes. (It’s always been a trick to save on word count, but their extensive use tends to support other evidence.) \n\n\n## 4. Tricolons (especially ascending tricolons)\n\nA tricolon is a rhetorical device involving three parts. I’m not going to go into detail about the history, but they’re particularly prevalent in literature from all around the world. Famous examples include:\n\n* \"*veni, vidi, vici*\" (I came, I saw, I conquered)\n* \"Stop, drop, and roll\"\n* \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\"\n* \"truth, justice, and the American way,\" \n* \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" \n\nTricolons are especially prevalent in American political speech. Abraham Lincoln's [Gettysburg Address,](https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm), John F. Kennedy's [\"we choose to go to the moon\"](https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/historic-speeches/address-at-rice-university-on-the-nations-space-effort) speech, and Barack Obama's [second inaugural address](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/21/inaugural-address-president-barack-obama) are replete with them. There are even “nested tricolons,” in which the third element of a tricolon is a tricolon itself. \n\nBefore ChatGPT, tricolons were common rhetorical devices in college admissions essays. I observed that some good writers would use them without even being conscious of it (a student of mine who got into Yale’s Eli Whitney non-traditional undergraduate program used them beautifully despite no formal writing education). But ChatGPT *loves* them. In particular, it makes extensive use of “ascending” tricolons, in which the three items are progressively longer, or the first two are an equal number of syllables and the third is greater. Most of the examples above ascending tricolons. \n\nHere are some examples of how ChatGPT uses tricolons (I prompted it):\n\n>I honed my skills in research, collaboration, and problem-solving.\n\n>My love for literature grew from fascination to passion to purpose.\n\n>I have learned to persevere in the face of challenges, to embrace new opportunities, and to lead with empathy and conviction.\n\nIf I see one tricolon in an essay, I'm not usually suspicious. If I see four or five, I can be almost certain ChatGPT had a “hand” in it. If you used ChatGPT to help with your essays, how many tricolons can you spot?\n\n\n## 5. “I [verb]ed that the true meaning of X is not only Y, it's also Z”\n\nThis is a college essay cliché that ChatGPT takes up to 11. I see this a *lot.* Here are some examples:\n \n>I learned that the true meaning of leadership is not only about guiding others—it's also about listening and learning from them.\n\n\n>I realized that genuine success is not just about achieving personal goals, but contributing to the well-being of humanity.\n\n\n>I came to appreciate that the core of resilience is not only enduring hardship; it's also finding strength through vulnerability.\n\nComment if you just re-read your essays and cringed!\n\n## 6. “As I [synonym for advance in my education], I will [synonym for carry or incorporate] this [lesson or value]”\n\nThis is a common conclusion ChatGPT uses. Again, on its own it might not be a red flag, but it provides circumstantial evidence. Examples:\n\n>As I progress in my academic journey, I will continue to integrate these principles into my work and life.\n\n\n>As I delve deeper into my field of study, I will strive to uphold the values of curiosity and integrity that shaped me.\n\n\n>As I grow as a learner and individual, I will ensure that this lesson guides my decisions and aspirations.\n\nThese aren’t quotes from actual students’ essays, but I’ve seen a lot of this stuff lately.\n\n## 7. “Lord of the Rings” syndrome (multiple endings)\n\nOne famous criticism of the Lord of the Rings films, in particular the third movie *Return of the King,* is that they have multiple scenes (as many as six depending on the version) that could stand alone as endings. \n\nIf not prompted otherwise, ChatGPT writes very formulaic and clichéd endings (and will suggest the same for revisions). It also tends to write multiple endings. I find that ChatGPT’s writing is more often than not improved by deleting the final sentence or paragraph. People do this too, especially when trying to pad word count, but it’s a reflection of what ChatGPT “thinks” a good essay looks like based on thousands of examples. \n\nOften, these multiple endings include clichés 2, 3, and/or 4 above. If one of the essay’s possible endings is about the true meaning of something, or an explicit look to the future, and/or contains an em dash—then I know it was probably ChatGPT. \n\n## What this means\n\nOne of the students whose essays I reviewed admitted he used ChatGPT, but he wasn't worried because he ran it through several AI detectors, and they came up with low percentages. Yet I could tell right away, and I’d bet most admissions officers could as well \n\nI don't claim to be better than any particular AI detector, but I do caution students (and universities) about relying on them. Reading is an intuitive process, and admissions officers (as well as professional counselors) have a large dataset of their own they’ve trained on, in particular essays from students of similar backgrounds. ChatGPT’s dataset likely doesn’t have a lot of demographic data about the authors of particular essays it's trained on.\n\nCollege admissions essays have never been a great test of writing ability. Admissions offices encourage students to get feedback from others, and spelling and grammar-check software has been around a long time. There are also professionals who help students brainstorm, outline, revise, and polish their essays, and may have a “heavy hand” in the process. Then there are other less scrupulous people who will straight out write essays for applicants. But colleges have never taken significant measures to mitigate this. They *could*, with proctored writing tests and such, but they’ve never really cared enough. I find it curious that it’s only now that ChatGPT is accessible to *everyone*—not just privileged families—that some colleges seem to care. \n\nAt some point I'll probably write a post about how applicants *should* use ChatGPT, but this post should illuminate what you *shouldn’t* let it do: write or rewrite large sections of your essays. \n\nAs an aside, in the past two years, ChatGPT has made me a better writer. And it's not because I have it provide feedback on my social media posts and communications, but because I challenge myself to write *better* than ChatGPT. It’s one of the most astounding inventions in the history of the world, but it's still limited. GPTs rely heavily on what *is.* Creative writing—and art in general—is about expanding the realm of what *might be*.\n\nAnd no, I did not use AI to write that. \n\n*Addendum: When I asked ChatGPT to evaluate my post up to this point, it told me to “tie your observations back to the importance of originality in writing and provide actionable advice for students,” and—I kid you not—suggested the following conclusion unprompted:*\n\n>\"The ability to recognize ChatGPT’s writing patterns is increasingly important, not only for admissions officers but for students striving to produce authentic and compelling essays. While AI is a powerful tool, true creativity lies in pushing beyond what it predicts to explore new possibilities. **Writing is about more than filling a page—it’s about telling a story that only you can tell.**\"\n\nWhen I pointed out that this suggestion used four of the seven clichés I listed, it came up with this version:\n\n>Recognizing ChatGPT’s patterns helps us understand both its strengths and its limitations as a writing tool. While AI-generated essays may appear polished, they often lack the originality and context that make human writing **resonate**. For students, this is a reminder to focus on authenticity and individuality. **After all, the most compelling essays are not those that follow formulas, but those that reflect a writer’s unique voice and perspective.**\n\nWhen I pushed it to eliminate clichés, it doubled down and introduced others:\n\n>**ChatGPT is a mirror, reflecting back what it’s been taught, polished and predictable. The best essays, however, aren't mirrors—they're windows, revealing something unexpected, personal, and alive.** If the goal is to stand out, the strategy is simple: write something no AI could ever predict, because only you lived it.\n\nAfter I tried to prompt it not use my clichés, it came back with a tricolon (descending this time), an em dash, a version of “X is not about Y, it's about Z,” and an extended metaphor about mirrors and windows!\n\nChatGPT isn’t wrong, and this is not bad writing. But this is the “voice” of ChatGPT.\n\nI think I've found a limit. "

    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1gw0by5/some_perspectives_from_the_other_side/",
    "body": "I am a professor on the admissions committee at a medium sized T20 engineering department in the US and wanted to share some honest perspectives from the other side, as we often aren't allowed to explicitly answer certain types of applicant questions. For example, many applicants want to know our acceptance rate which are not supposed to share. My program accepts roughly 35-40 students out of 600+ applications, and our yield tends to be somewhere between 50-60% of those admits join the program.\n\n**Our process:** the admissions committee reviews applicants and ranks them on a score from 1 to 3, where 1 is excellent, 2 is good, and 3 is unsuitable. Most applicants are fairly realistic about their chances of getting in, I would estimate roughly 10% get rank 1, 85% rank 2, and only 5% of odd cases are ranked 3. After that, the scores and application materials are shared with the rest of the department. We are a direct-match program (i.e., students get accepted directly to individual lab groups, rather than as a cohort), so individual PIs then get to decide who they will interview. The admissions committee will make notes of which professors should look closely at which applicants. Not every professor will have funding for new PhD students every year, so many applications (even excellent ones) are never strongly considered. Rank 2 applicants are sometimes accepted if the research fit with the professor is very good.\n\nYou may have heard this before, but there is **no such thing as a safety school** for graduate applications. We routinely reject rank 1 applicants simply because there isn't a professor in their field of interest who has an open position that year. So having the best profile does not mean you will get accepted, you also need to get lucky that the right position in the right group is funded for you that year. For smaller, less research active schools, this means that there are often fewer positions available, so some of those programs may actually be harder to get into compared to larger and higher ranked programs like MIT, Michigan, and Georgia Tech which need to hire large numbers of students to support their massive research programs.\n\n**GPA matters.** While research proficiency is most important for a PhD, a poor undergraduate GPA doesn't bode well for your chances of successfully completing the pre-requisite coursework in a graduate program. These classes are hard, and if you are spending all of your time studying just to do okay, you won't have time to start research and your chances of passing the qualifying exam will be lower. Many professors consider \\~3.7 or above to be acceptable, but top applicants usually have 3.8 or above. I don't say this to discourage you if your GPA is lower, but I also don't want to sugar coat what type of profile tends to be accepted.\n\nA question I see all of the time is: **does research experience offset a mediocre GPA?** The diplomatic answer you'll get from most admissions staff is that applications are reviewed holistically and there is no minimum GPA. But the honest answer is: probably not. Several applicants will have both research experience and an excellent GPA, and in many cases the \"superstar\" rank 1 candidates will have a higher GPA **in addition** to more research experience than a rank 2 applicant with a decent GPA and some research experience.  Out of the 100s of applications I have read, I can only think of one case where a candidate had a 3.2 GPA but such excellent research experience and letters of recommendation that the application was still strongly considered.\n\nAnother common misconception is the importance of publishing as an undergraduate or masters student. Having a publication can certainly boost your application, but it is far from a prerequisite. We routinely accept students who have no publications. Doing science takes time, and doing good science is usually especially slow. In fact, having your name on subpar publications might actually work against you. I was recently contacted by an international masters student who has more publications than me, because their father is a professor who has been adding their name to all of his (not very good) publications for the last 6 years. I am fairly confident that this super-obvious \"gaming\" of the academic system will result in this student getting rejected from all top programs. Then they will go to grad cafe or reddit and complain about how impossible it is to get accepted into graduate school if they got rejected despite having X number of papers. So don't get discouraged if you haven't published when you read those types of posts!\n\nAnother common question seems to be whether international students are at a disadvantage. The sad answer is yes. This is for a few reasons: (1) there are many funding mechanisms only open to US students (the big one being NSF GRFP, but there are several others), making it easier for professors without enough funding to accept them, (2) we know exactly what a 3.9/4.0 from the University of Delaware means, it might be harder to evaluate a 9.0/10 from IISc, (3) we are more likely to have a connection to, or know of, the professors at American universities writing letters for those students. The deck is especially stacked against Iranian applicants. Although there are many wonderful junior scientists in Iran we would love to bring over, the reality of visa delays/rejections and extra scrutiny means many programs/professors can't or won't gamble on making offers to those students. If you are international, don't give up hope though! There aren't enough excellent American students to fill all the US programs, so most top schools still end up with a majority of international students. You just might need to apply more broadly than an American student would.\n\nMake sure to get your applications in on time, including letters of recommendation and IETLS/TOEFL scores. While exceptions might be made for superstar candidates, last year we weren't even forwarded the applications that weren't completed at the deadline. I had a few students reach out to me to ask if I'd seen their application, and I hadn't because their IETLS scores were delayed and the admissions staff had only sent us complete applications.\n\nMy final thought is to make sure your personal statement reads well, especially the first few paragraphs. This is the first part of the application we look at and we generally make a judgement fairly early in reading. I try to do the courtesy of reading each statement in its entirety because I feel that we owe that to applicants who put so much time into applying, but the reality is that many professors will skim the statements and make a snap judgement since we are analyzing so many.  If you aren't a strong writer, **use AI** to help! AI writing tools can help level the playing field for non-native English speakers. **However, do not** copy and paste directly from chatgpt. It is incredibly obvious when someone has done so. Make sure the statement still has your distinct voice and thoughts and does not include generic wording that doesn't tell us anything about you. Sentences such as \"I love XX field because I have always liked math and physics\" are true of every engineering applicant. I want to know more about you as a person, and every word you choose to include in this statement should help make your case. I realize that this is easy advice to give, and not easy advice to incorporate, but do your best to think about what makes you unique and interesting. Also, don't be afraid to brag a about your accomplishments. If you have published, won awards, conducted outreach, etc., include that in your statement. Give us context for awards we may not have heard of (selected out of XX applicants), include metrics of impact (my outreach project was shared with XX number of low income students). Give us context to your research experiences (how long were you with a group, did you work alone or under a postdoc/phd student, what tools did you use, what were your main contributions to any resulting publications, etc.). And of course, have someone proofread. Sentences that make sense to you might sound like gibberish to someone else, which is why we often cannot effectively evaluate our own writing.\n\nI hope this helps, best of luck with your applications everyone!\n\n  \n**Edit:** I am going to stop replying and close reddit on my computer soon, as I need to do some real work, but wanted to share a few final thoughts based on responses.\n\nA number of comments are asking for \"chance me\" based on their profile, which is really difficult to do. If you take away anything from this post, it should be that graduate admissions can be very subjective and even random, especially when decisions are left to each individual professor. You can absolutely be accepted to a top program with a 3.2, and you can also be rejected with a 4.0. The last thing I want to do is discourage anyone from pursuing their dream program, but I also want to be honest about what types of candidates are typically accepted to top programs. For example, my last few years of admits:\n\n* 3.5 UG, 3.9 M.S. International, 2 research experiences, 1 publication, 1 presentation, leadership experience, letter of recommendation from a professor I know and trust. SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific research field and as well as the application I care about\n* 3.85 UG, 3.95 MS. International, 2 research experiences, 2 presentations and 1 in-progress publications (but not published), leadership and volunteer experience. Referred by trusted colleague, excellent research fit.  \n* 16.5/20 UG, 3.7 MS. International, 3 research experiences, 2 publications, significant outreach experience, amazing letters of recommendation from unknown professors. SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific research and application I care about\n* 3.98 UG GPA. American, URM, 2 research experiences, no publications, significant outreach experience. Letter from a trusted colleague.  SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific field and and application\n* 3.8 UG GPA, dual major. American, URM, 2 research experiences, presentation but no publications, excellent leadership experience, referred by a trusted colleague. SOP a bit vague but good enough alignment with my research \n* 3.9 UG GPA, american. Top UG program. Awards, 1 research experience, one publication, 2 presentations, volunteer, leadership, outreach experience, excellent letters from unknown professors. SOP reflected good alignment with my research, but not with my application.  \n\nYou might notice a common theme is that referrals/letters from other professors I know personally hold a lot of weight. I have used the phrase \"take a gamble\" a lot in my comments, because that is what we are doing when we accept students. In between tuition, stipend, fringe, overhead, and research/travel costs, it costs over $100,000/year to train a PhD student at my institution. This is money we professors need to painstakingly fundraise. Because PhD positions are some weird combination of a job and a training program, making a bad hire can have an enormous impact on our research programs. It's not like a normal job where I can just fire someone if they aren't working out 2 months in. The last thing any professor wants to do is spend 200-300k training someone who ultimately isn't productive and burns out early because they actually don't care about the research area. This is why programs are so weird about \"**why us?**\" We want you to convince us that you will be happy and successful in this program and aren't going to drop out.  You might be the strongest applicant in the pile in terms of raw metrics, but if we don't see the clear alignment of interests you may not be accepted. \n\nPersonally, I am also very interested in personality match. I don't want to spend 5 years butting heads with someone because we have different priorities and working styles, and I especially don't want someone who will make the rest of my group miserable by being a pain to work with. This is why I put a lot of weight into personal recommendations from people I know. By the time I am interviewing candidates, it's really more of a \"vibe check\" than trying to assess competency. All professors are different though, some will really grill candidates for technical competency, which I personally find unproductive. \n\nFinally, if your profile is not as strong as the ones I have mentioned, please **do not despair** or give up hope on doing a PhD. I am describing the admissions process at a very competitive top program located in a highly desirable city. There are many R1s with high research activities and plenty of funding that don't make it onto top 20 lists. For example, state schools in \"rural\" states have access to a separate pot of NSF funding that coastal states do not have. The university of texas system has their own sizeable endowment. There are many excellent, T100 programs physically adjacent to top schools that are sometimes overlooked by applicants (i.e., NJIT near Princeton). Top schools located in less desirable locations will also be less selective. Because of the political climate there, colleagues from red / southern states have been complaining recently about not getting enough female and out-of-state applicants in their pools. Canadian programs have a very different funding mechanism than the US which results in more equitable distribution of funding across their various schools. Finally, try to find out if a program of interest has hired a lot of new professors recently, which suggests that the school has funding and potentially more openings for PhD students. \n\nIf you do decide to apply to top programs, make sure the alignment is clear in your SOP, and try not to take it as a personal failing if you end up not being selected. We all want to believe in a meritocracy with a fair and systematic process, but the reality is that professors making these decisions are just people and the system we use is sometimes arbitrary or downright stupid. We make mistakes, we overlook good candidates for stupid reasons or because of personal biases, we spend less time on applicants describing research interests far from our own fields, we forget to read the last 2 applications on the pile of 100s, etc. I know candidates often want to know \"what was wrong with my application that I didn't get selected?\" but this is the wrong way to think about it because there may have been nothing wrong with your application. In reality, it was just that something in someone else's profile that made them stand out to that particularly professor, such as a letter of recommendation from the right person. "

    "body": "I know how anxiety-inducing, stressful, and confusing the PhD admissions experience is, and I wanted to share some of the things I’ve learned along the way. If you have any specific questions I didn’t cover here feel free to ask, and if you want help on your specific situation feel free to message me!\n\nBrief background: I gained admission to 10 PhD programs, all of which were in the top 20s for their respective fields (Chemical Biology, Biosciences, Molecular and Cellular Biology)— 5 were in the top 10 in the United States. I got 5 rejections. I now participate in my program’s student admissions committee, meaning that I participate in the evaluation of applicants, interview students, and get an inside view into the admissions process. I’ve also helped many prospective students with their applications, so I’ve seen a lot of the common pitfalls that come with these kinds of applications. I love helping people figure their path, and I find myself giving many of these pieces of advice to everyone who is applying so I thought I’d put it all in one place in case any of you are in this boat.\n\nBecause I had a low GPA and less undergraduate research experience than my peers, I was extremely intentional about how I approached the process, and tried to set myself up for success as much as possible. While this is nowhere near comprehensive, I wanted to share some of what I’ve learned. Much of this is geared towards PhDs broadly in the biological sciences in the US, but I hope much of it translates to other disciplines. \n\nPicking schools and programs\n\n* Before doing anything else, clarify *what* you want to do and *why* you want to do it. If you don’t know the answer yet, you may not be ready for a PhD. I often see applicants who want a PhD but don’t care deeply about a specific problem or field. That lack of authentic passion comes across clearly in applications and interviews. You don't have to narrow it down to a granular level but you should have broad scientific questions you're eager to address. The best thing you can do is focus and narrow your field.\n* You might assume that applying to many different fields or types of programs increases your chances of getting in somewhere, but that’s not necessarily true. PhD programs heavily weigh your demonstrated interest in their specific discipline. If you have relevant experience and can talk about it with insight, passion, and clarity, you’ll stand out.\n* Start with the type of research and the PIs, not the school or the program. Once you know what you want to study, identify faculty whose work aligns with those interests. This matters far more than rankings or school names, and the process takes time. If you can list PIs whose research connects to your background and interests, your application will be far more compelling.\n* Figuring out what you want to study and narrowing that down is a process in itself. Broadly: read as much as possible, attend as many seminars as you can (especially in person), ask questions, and speak with the presenters if possible.\n* Lots of informational interviews with students. I probably had around 20 coffee chats with current PhD students, asking about their paths, how they got into grad school, and what kind of research they’re doing now. These conversations helped me clarify my own goals and direction.\n* Don’t treat this like applying to college. You don’t need “safeties”—the safety is simply not doing a PhD. Don’t apply to programs you wouldn’t seriously consider attending. It’s a waste of time, energy, and money.\n\nShowing real passion\n\n* Programs want to know that you genuinely want to pursue a PhD, and it’s difficult to fake true enthusiasm. A PhD is long, and difficult— if you don’t love this kind of work, you’re unlikely to stick with it. Don’t be afraid to show your excitement in your personal statement, emails, and interviews.\n* A PhD requires initiative and independent. If you can’t do basic research about a program, lab, or field, that’s a red flag. Don’t ask questions that are easily answered by a Google search or on the program’s website. The people you're contacting, like faculty, administrators, and students, have more input into admissions than you might expect.\n* On the flip side, asking thoughtful and specific questions works in your favor. It shows that you’ve done your homework and are seriously interested. I have a long list of questions I asked PIs during interviews: questions about mentorship style, research direction, lab culture, etc. Never ask something you could have found online.\n* Remember: a PhD is a professional degree. Act accordingly. Proofread your emails. Treat everyone with respect. Be proactive and prepared. How you conduct yourself in these small interactions reflects on your overall readiness for this type of work.\n* And if you’re not quite ready, that’s completely okay. There’s no shame in taking time to work before applying. I did, and it benefitted me immensely.\n\nEmailing/connecting with PIs before applying\n\n* At many schools with rotational programs, admissions decisions aren’t just a matter of ranking applicants. If a PI on the committee likes you, you may be evaluated differently. That’s why making connections in advance can give you an edge. It’s absolutely essential for direct-admit programs, and still very important for rotational ones. \n* That said, I’ve seen a lot of poorly written PI emails that probably hurt the applicant more than they helped. When contacting a PI, your main goal is to demonstrate why you’d be an asset to their lab and express your genuine interest in joining if admitted. If you have a clear vision for your PhD, that will come through naturally. Avoid sending a generic or templated email. Do ask to meet if they have time. And don’t be discouraged if they don’t respond—it doesn’t necessarily reflect your chances of admission.\n* You can also email them with specific questions; for example, if they have multiple affiliations, you can ask them which program they think would be a better fit to apply to if you’re interested in their lab. \n* If you have a direct connection to a PI of interest, use it. For example, if your current PI collaborates with someone at a school you're applying to, ask them to make the introduction (ideally by email, CCing you).\n* Reaching out to big-name, senior PIs with huge, well-funded labs usually doesn’t lead anywhere. Focus instead on early- or mid-career faculty whose work genuinely excites you. They’re more likely to respond—and more likely to be on the admissions committee.\n\nEssay writing \n\n* START EARLY. I guarantee every school is going to ask for slightly different essays and while you can recycle some material, it’s going to need to be highly tailored to each school. They will definitely be able to tell if it’s a copy-paste situation. \n* Spend a lot of time in the brainstorming stage of your essay. Don’t sit down and try to write something complete from start to finish; I guarantee it will be bad. Instead, take the time to reflect on your path and your motivations, and write down everything that comes to mind. Even if 1% of this brainstorm is usable, it will be worthwhile. Then, you can slowly shape it into an essay. \n* Proofread!! Submitting something with the wrong school name, a misspelled PI, or careless errors signals a lack of attention and professionalism.\n* For rotational programs, the unspoken convention is to list three professors you are interested in working with, along with a brief few sentences about why you want to work with them and what you can contribute. You can deviate from this but it worked for me and many others. \n* Speaking with current students will both help you narrow down your schools list and give you good talking points in your essay. They want to see that you are aware of the unique strengths of the program, and that you will take advantage of their resources.\n* Get as much feedback as possible on your essays. Send it to your professors, to current students, post-docs you’ve worked with, etc. \n* Nobody talks about this, but many people with the financial means to do so hire a professional application consultant to help shape every aspect of their application. While I believe this is not at all necessary, recognize that you’re competing against people with the resources to fully polish each element of their application with the help of an expert. In order to compete, your best bet is going to be to solicit as much mentorship and feedback as you possibly can from professors and peers. \n\nHow to speak and interview well\n\n* I find that undergraduate researchers are often not very good at articulating their work in the broader context of the field. While you do not need to be an expert, you need to be able to explain what you were doing beyond the basic assay. When someone asks about your research, or when you need to write about it, don’t start with the technique; start with the problem. Convince them that it’s important, explain where the gap is, explain how your work fills the gap, and finally tell them what you’re specifically doing. \n* This is where reading widely and attending talks comes in handy. For example, if great novelists did not read books themselves, they would not know how to write good books. Similarly, if you don’t immerse yourself in the language scientists use to talk about their research, you will be at a disadvantage when it comes to explaining your own work. \n* Get good at asking questions! If you’re still in school force yourself to ask questions during class and in seminars. When reading a paper think of questions to ask that cannot readily be answered by Google or by a second read of the text. The questions you ask during informational interviews with PIs or during real interviews might say more about you than your answers to questions. \n* Formulate answers to common interview questions thoughtfully. Be earnest, don’t exaggerate or try to paint yourself in an overly positive light, but do show your genuine passion. \n* Practice a lot!! Practice with peers and with professors and mentors. Informational PI interviews (set up by emailing them) are a great way to gain interview practice to prepare for real evaluative interviews. I have a long list of interview questions I can provide if it would be helpful! \n* At the interview weekend, act as if absolutely everybody is evaluating you, even other prospective students. We overhear conversations, and we see how you treat your peers. At the interview stage, we’re looking for any reason to decline somebody; don’t give us anything. Do show real curiosity, and engage with current students as much as possible. This will ultimately help you make a choice! \n\nUltimately, as stressful as this application process is, it’s also a really beautiful time to reflect on your path thus far, and to clarify what you want to do in the future. When you approach the process with this mindset, it becomes a little less intimidating and more exciting!\n\nI hope at least some of this was helpful— I’m happy to answer any specific questions or do my best to help in any other way!"

After the Supreme Court banned affirmative action in higher education, the Trump administration has said it will require schools to prove they no longer consider race in admissions. The number of first-year students self-identifying as Asian American grew to 27% from 24% last year, and students identifying as Black or African American dropped by nearly four percentage points to 5%. Around 14% of the incoming class is international, a cohort that has been threatened by visa delays in recent months."

I can be unorganized, I tend to not ask for help, and I somehow always leave things to the last minute, even when I don't intend to.\n\nI think I want to get into a top program for my ego and to feel like my time and effort wasn't wasted, but there's a very likely chance that I don't get into one of my preferred programs, or none at all.\n\nSo I'm writing here to remind myself that no matter what happens, I am going to be an amazing researcher. Whether it's at my top school or outside of a PhD program entirely, I am going to do work that I can be proud of. I'm doing this because I care about it, because I want to do good work, and because I want to contribute something to our understanding of the world.\n\nI hope that reading this can remind some of you why you're doing this, and takes some of the stress off of getting into the perfect program.\n\nNo matter what happens, we got this"

    "body": "Super long post, sorry!!\n\nHi there. I wanted to write this post for me and those who seem like they won't be able to make it into graduate school. Let me start with some basic information of myself. I started college back in 2017, currently 26 (I know I'm unc LMAO) but I started at my local community college. Long story, short, I swapped my majors twice and graduated with an AA in Computer Information Systems. I started my Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2020. With the pandemic happening so early into my degree, my grades suffered horribly. Lack of motivation, everything seemed so bleak, and I was just in a constant state of autopilot. My GPA tanked the first semester due to me failing classes. I wasn't helping either. I would skip, not pay attention, and didn't study as hard as I should've and that's on me. Inevitably, I went on Academic Warning during my first semester at the local university I was attending. Same formula applied in 2021 and followed until the Spring 2021 semester where I was put on Academic Probation. Which means, if you drop below the cumulative minimum GPA requirement, you're kicked from the program and dismissed from the university. I started to panic because of the mistakes I made early on. And so, with that harsh reality check, my advisor placed a credits limit until I could raise my GPA. At this point, I was at a 1.03 GPA. Yeah... it was not good LOL. Despite this low, I locked in as much as a could and I grinded my undergrad. Needless to say, I was able to graduate by December 2023 at 25. I did feel behind because of my past mistakes but I was able to tank through it and jump to a 2.3 GPA. Not the best. But, passable. Now, I wish I could say everything was fine and dandy but this will come back to haunt me later. \n\n  \nAfter graduating, it took me 6 months to find a full time job. Unfortunately, even now, the job market in tech is cooked. However, I was able to find a IT job and have been working here ever since 2024. Once I was comfortable and stable, I was debating on applying to grad school. Now, I need prefix this by saying, this is a HUGE decision - for me at least. Coming from a barely passable GPA, I was embarrassed and scared thinking I'm going to flunk out and have to deal with the embarrassment of failing graduate school. I took my sweet time until I was \"you know what? F it.\" I went out of my way to apply to a more prestigious university where I live. I applied to their Master of Science in Computer Science and their Master of Science in Software Engineering for the Fall 2025 semester. Now, this is where the \"GPA comes to haunt me later\" portion comes into play. I reached out to my undergrad CS professors from my community college (from almost 5-6 years ago!) and from my recent Junior/Senior level courses! Needless to say, I applied with 5 letters of recommendation, professional tech experience as I work in the field now, and a much clearer and more mature mindset. I wish I could also say that I was accepted into one or both programs! But, to no one's surprise, I was denied. From both programs. When I tell you the feeling of defeat I had was incomprehensible, it really was! I couldn't eat, didn't want to work out, I just kind of shut down. After a while of sulking, I looked back to the university I did in my undergrad and debated if I wanted to go back. Where I'm from, there are two well-known universities. The one I was denied from and the one I was almost flunked out of. So, I went right back to those same professors and they were able to assist me in writing another couple of LoRs. Now, as of writing this post, I am currently in my Master's of Computer Science program. I'm enrolled full-time while working my full-time job. I currently have straight A's in all of my classes. I'm turning in assignments on time and working on my projects bit by bit. So, I wanted to write something for those of you who have/had a low GPA during your undergrad and want to get into grad school:\n\n  \n1.) YOU CAN GET INTO GRAD SCHOOL WITH A LOW GPA!!!! Trust me! I, along with millions of other students, can attest you're able to get into it! I'm not saying it's easy. With a low GPA like mine, it's an uphill battle because you want to prove to the Admissions Committee that you're not just ready academically but ready mentally. \n\n2.) Choose your schools with realistic expectations. Don't expect to apply and get accepted into MIT, Harvard, Yale with a low GPA. I've seen students with 4.0 GPAs and a ton of research experience get outright denied! I'm not saying it's impossible, anything is possible, but don't expect to get accepted off the bat. Trust me, I thought I was ready but reality smacked me harder than Will Smith did Chris Rock. \n\n3.) Make your application the best it can be! Focus on your Statement of Purpose! This is extremely important. Address your low GPA! Don't focus on it completely. Mention it and acknowledge that it is a weak spot but that you're not who you were x amount of months/years ago. The SOP is for you to shine and give reason as to why your committee should choose you! Talk about what you've been doing, maybe about how your job ties to your degree, how you've grown and what steps you will taking to crush your grad programs! \n\n4.) Talk with your undergraduate professors! I never spoke to mine a lot but reach out to them! Invite them to talk over coffee on campus or maybe through a Zoom/Teams chat. Like the previous point, talk to your professor about what you've been doing. Show your passion and how excited/ready you are for this opportunity. More often than not, they will willing to help with a Letter of Recommendation!\n\n5.) Letters of Recommendations are important! Make sure you reach out to as many professors as you can! You may get ignored, some professors may not being teaching anymore, and you may even get a swift denial. Don't fret. Keep sending emails to as many as you can! I was denied by a few and ignored by others. That didn't stop me because I know I wanted into the program. Don't just stop at your professors, your manager at your job can help too! Especially if your job is related to your degree! This helps a ton! \n\n6.) Apply with time! From my knowledge and experience from applying, graduate programs have limited seating. So, only a certain amount of students will be accepted into the program. Check with your grad admissions office to see when the deadline is and apply as early as you can! Not saying applying early will get you in but it will certainly help you! \n\n7.) GIVE YOURSELF GRACE! This is something I struggle with to this day but grad applications are stressful and nerve-racking but taking the first step to want to further your education is something so big, you should feel proud that you're wanting to even take said step. \n\n  \nTLDR; You're worthy of the dreams and goals you aspire to reach. Sometimes the road is bumpy but, if you fall, you get up, pivot, and execute. You CAN get into grad school with a low GPA. I'll give you one last piece of advice blow:\n\n  \nOnce you get in and, YOU WILL,:\n\n8.) BE PROUD OF YOURSELF THAT YOU GOT IN! But, getting in is the first battle, once you are in, execute! Take advantage of everything you university has to offer! Join clubs, network, attend events, career fairs, adapt better study habits, don't procrastinate! You don't want to be in the same situation you were in previously. I know I don't and, for once, my grades are reflecting that. You got this, stranger, I believe in you! "

    "body": "Hey all, I just wanted to provide a little bit of a positive story/ some hope to some of you applying, especially my non-trad friends. \nUndergrad for me was hard. I was one of those high schoolers who largely breezed through those honors/ IB classes and I never really had to work too much. I attended a fairly competitive undergraduate university with a notoriously rigorous pre med program. I didn’t know how to study, but I also struggled with the death of close family member my first semester, and struggled incessantly with poorly managed OCD. I withdrew from chem my first year, got an A in it at community college, and thought I was back on the horse. The next year though, amidst the pandemic, I managed to get a number of Cs, and even one F in organic chemistry. By the end of undergrad, I had a decent upward trend, but I remember thinking to myself, “what happened? I thought I was smart.” I questioned every day whether I was worthy of this path. I finally worked up the courage to go to my pre med advisor my senior year, and hoped for some encouragement. The advisor looked at me, turned her computer monitor in my direction, with my transcript pulled up. “This,” she said, “will never get you into medical school.” “I would suggest you try nursing.” I was absolutely gutted. I broke down in tears in front of her, explaining that medicine had been my dream since I was about 5 years old. She basically told me that the only way I’d ever have a chance would be to get a Master’s degree, “if they would even give my application a second look.” After a full day of bed rotting and watching Jersey shore to recover, I decided that I would do whatever it took to reach my goal. I applied with my 3.3 gpa to a graduate program in biology. I got in, and worked my butt off while simultaneously studying for the MCAT, working as a CNA in a nursing home, doing public health and biology research, shadowing in the ER, and volunteering with the crisis text line. I took my mcat, graduated with a 3.7, and promptly applied this past summer. \n\nTwo gap years, two degrees, and many bumps in the roads later, I received 7 interviews this cycle, and was accepted to my top choice program. \nMy point here is this- do not give up hope. If your heart and soul are in this, you have the ability to succeed. Good grades and scores and experiences are key, absolutely, but tenacity and determination are just as important. They aren’t joking when they say that medicine is a calling- and if you believe you are destined for it, you’d better stay on that damn line- and don’t let anyone tell you to throw in the towel. You don’t need to be a perfect applicant for people to see your potential. And in my humble opinion, people with trials and tribulations often can make the most empathetic and passionate physicians. \n\nIf you’re feeling down at this point in the cycle, it’s okay. It’s understandable- this is all so hard. But know that nobody has the power to dim your light if your heart is set strongly enough on your goals. You’re worthy of this path. Best of luck to everyone; my DMs are always open ❤️\n\nSincerely, \nan imperfect, incredibly grateful, future DO"

    "body": "# I will not respond to DMs on this topic. Please share here if you have a question. We need to unify this information and keep it accessible.\n\nSeeing posts with uninformed advice on this topic. My goal is to create a thread of factual, though anecdotal, information. I get dozens of messages about this topic from people who have been accepted to medical school and matched residency as well. Please feel free to ask anything, but I request you don't give advice unless you have some first-hand experience, are on an admissions committee or are an attorney. Committing a crime can't be taken lightly and I'm not advocating that everyone who has done so is appropriate for medical school. However if an applicant has shown growth and maturity, it shouldn't hold someone back.\n\nAbout me:\n\n* I was accepted to an established **DO school with average matriculant stats at the time: 503/3.5**. I'm a woman and not underrepresented in medicine. All other aspects of my application: research, leadership, clinical experience, were about average as well. I got 2 DO interviews and 1 acceptance.\n* The felony was **cannabis-related and was 9 years old** when I was accepted. It had been **expunged**. I stopped using substances after that, but I drink alcohol. I was not a minor but was a teenager when it occurred.\n* I was **expelled from college when I got arrested**. When I reapplied to undergraduate several year later, I was accepted as a transfer but had to meet with the University head of security to explain the incident before I was able to matriculate.\n* I took many working gap years. I had a service role in the upscale restaurant industry.\n\nApplication advice:\n\n* You need to **demonstrate consistent integrity, responsibility and professionalism** in your application.\n* Criminal **record needs to be 5 years old when you apply** to medical school.\n* I addressed my criminal record in my personal statement for medical school, and **disclosed at all junctures in applications**. It came up in a handful of residency interviews but not in any medical school interviews.\n* **Some records are worse**\\-appearing to adcoms than others. Multiple offenses seem to be a non-starter because it shows the applicant didn't learn. I haven't spoken with anyone with a sexual offense, murder or manslaughter yet. I have spoken to numerous people with speeding, parking violations, DUIs, cannabis use and violent offenses including bar fights. Have also spoken to women with domestic violence charges due to the physical altercation involving both parties. Have spoken to a few with substance distribution charges.\n\nLicensing:\n\n* You will need to report the record to register with Medicaid/Medicare, which is required in most programs, if it is ≤10 years old.\n* Concerned applicants should **do an** [FBI background check](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/identity-history-summary-checks/identity-history-summary-checks-faqs) **on themselves**. My FBI background check comes up clear.  It's about $35. Almost all state licenses require a background check. Many hospitals also require a **Certiphi background check**, which would be done at the end of 2nd year prior to clinical rotations.\n\nI'll edit this top post as I get questions.\n\nThis is the best popular medical school advising source I've found on the topic:\n\n[https://medicalschoolhq.net/pmy-197-can-become-doctor-youve-arrested/](https://medicalschoolhq.net/pmy-197-can-become-doctor-youve-arrested/)"

    "body": "I just noticed that the new 2025 version of the Carnegie classifications might be shaking up how US News categorizes colleges, at least if they follow suit.  Apologies if this has been discussed before.\n\nBy way of background, US News for its current rankings puts institutions into buckets (National Universities, National Liberal Arts Colleges, and so on) based on their 2021 Carnegie classifications.  A mapping is available here:\n\n[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-category-definitions](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-category-definitions)\n\nAs of 2021, tech-focused doctoral research universities like MIT were in the same category as, say, Harvard.  Harvey Mudd, though, was in the same category as LACs like Williams.  And then colleges like Rose-Hulman were specialty schools without a general ranking, but Rose ended up at the top of the US News rankings for Engineering at institutions without a PhD program.\n\nOK, but for 2025, Carnegie has changed things such that all of institutions like MIT, Mudd, and Rose-Hulman are in the new Special Focus: Technology, Engineering, and Sciences category.  Harvard is in Mixed Undergraduate/Graduate-Doctorate, and Williams is in Special Focus: Arts and Sciences.\n\nOther institutions in the Mixed category with Harvard include the rest of YPS, and the other general interest research universities like that.  But the new Special Focus: Technology, Engineering, and Sciences category got institutions like [Caltech](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/california-institute-of-technology/572), [CMU](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/carnegie-mellon-university/152), [Georgia Tech](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/georgia-institute-of-technology/233), [RPI](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/rensselaer-polytechnic-institute/412), Cooper Union, and WPI.\n\nI think it would be great if US News followed this.  It has long made no sense that people talk like MIT or Caltech or such are the same sort of institution as Harvard or Yale or Chicago.  And in fact, it makes sense people really interested in MIT would be most interested in colleges like CMU, RPI, or indeed Mudd, not other mixed universities.\n\nBut I am not sure US News will follow.  It would be a big change, no matter how warranted.  But then again, what would generate the most clicks . . . ."

    "body": "Often when people speak of college prestige, they confuse lay prestige and what I would call \"real prestige.\" Lay prestige is concerned with the opinion the layman. Basically, if you were to tell Dale - the pizza delivery guy from Omaha - or Joey - the construction worker from Newark - where you went to college, would they be impressed? Dale thinks that Georgetown is much more impressive than UChicago and Joey is convinced that the Yale School of Management is better than Northwestern Kellogg. In my opinion this is very far from \"real prestige,\" which is the reputation a college has with those who are \"in the know\" and whose opinion might actually impact the graduates of those colleges (through, for example, job recruitment or graduate admissions).\n\nThis metric is captured fairly well by the USNWR \"peer reputation score.\" However, since we don't have access to that data and because it is likely biased towards academia, I thought it would be a fun exercise to create such a ranking myself.\n\nI did not use a formula to construct this list - it's based purely on vibes. However, for reference, here are some metrics which I considered while creating it:\n\n* Endowment per student\n* Student/faculty ratio\n* Teaching quality\n* Student quality\n* Graduation rate\n* Med school placement\n* Law school placement\n* Business school placement\n* PhD placement\n* High finance placement\n* Consulting placement\n* Median salary\n\nSome of these metrics measure the presumed result of prestige (e.g. placement numbers) while some measure the cause of prestige (e.g. student/faculty ratio). Regardless, I think they are, in aggregate, decent measures of the concept.\n\nNote: This ranking only considers undergraduate institutions and thus includes both traditional LACs and the undergraduate colleges of universities. It does not consider highly specialized and/or untraditional institutions like conservatories, service academies, women's colleges, or whatever Harvey Mudd is. Colleges/universities appear in no particular order within their own tier. Because LACs are incorporated into this list things get messy very quickly...\n\n**Tier 1 (HYPSM + Caltech)**\n\n* Harvard University\n* Yale University\n* Princeton University\n* Stanford University\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n* California Institute of Technology\n\nHYPSM is a no brainer. I feel that Caltech carries a similarly spotless reputation.\n\n**Tier 2 (The Mid Tier Ivies + Duke + UofC)**\n\n* University of Pennsylvania\n* Columbia University\n* Duke University\n* University of Chicago\n\nAll of these schools excel across the board and are competitive with HYPSM in many areas. One interesting statistic is that, other than HYPSM+C, these are the only universities to ever be ranked within the top 5 of USNWR post 1980 (rankings were really weird before then).\n\n**Tier 3 (The Lower Ivies + WASP + Ivy+)**\n\n* Dartmouth College\n* Brown University\n* Cornell University\n* Williams College\n* Amherst College\n* Swarthmore College\n* Pomona College\n* Rice University\n* Northwestern University\n* Johns Hopkins University\n\nThis is where things might become more contentious. All of these institutions have something holding them back from a higher ranking. Cornell and Johns Hopkins are fantastic research institutions but that comes at the detriment of their undergraduate programs. On the flip side, Dartmouth and WASP have great placement numbers and endowments, however, they lack some of the resources/opportunities of large research universities.\n\n**Tier 4 (Top Publics + Schools in the Middle of Nowhere + Top LACs + GTown)**\n\n* University of California, Berkeley\n* University of California, Los Angeles\n* University of Michigan\n* University of Virginia\n* Notre Dame University\n* Vanderbilt University\n* Washington University in St. Louis\n* Carnegie Mellon University\n* Bowdoin College\n* Middlebury College\n* Claremont McKenna College\n* Georgetown University\n\nVery large and diverse group right here. It's difficult to rank public universities because they are so different in character to their private counterparts, but I feel like this is reasonable position for them to be in. Carnegie Mellon computer science would be ranked much higher than this - which kind of highlights the absurdity of these kinds of rankings. Overall, this looks very similar to USNWR #15 - #21. Maybe I am being subconsciously influenced by this years ranking or maybe they just got it right.\n\n**Tier 5 (Southern Schools + Rich Kid Schools + Many More LACs)**\n\n* Emory University\n* University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n* University of Texas at Austin\n* University of Southern California\n* New York University\n* Tufts University\n* Boston College\n* Haverford College\n* Washington and Lee University\n* Grinnell College\n* Vassar College\n* Davidson College\n* Hamilton College\n* Wesleyan University\n* Carleton College\n\nA lot of these schools are excellent in certain areas but middling in others. NYU, BC, UNC, USC, and UT Austin are all great for business. NYU and USC are also great for the arts. However, these programs don't necessarily uplift the rest of the school. The LACs have great placement in academia but comparatively mediocre placement in industry.\n\n**Tier 6 (The End)**\n\n* University of Florida\n* Georgia Institute of Technology\n* University of California, San Diego\n* University of California, Davis\n* University of California, Irvine\n* Boston University\n* University of Richmond\n* Colgate University\n* Colby College\n* Bates College\n\nObviously Georgia Tech Engineering and CS would be much higher. This is an arbitrary cut off point.\n\nHere are the schools ranked in order for fun...\n\n1. Harvard University\n2. Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n3. Princeton University\n4. Stanford University\n5. Yale University\n6. California Institute of Technology\n7. Duke University\n8. University of Pennsylvania\n9. University of Chicago\n10. Columbia University\n11.

After months of filling out application forms and hundreds of dollars spent on application fees (waivers were hard to receive), I've been rejected from 9/10 of the programs I applied for. I have nearly no hope for the last one.\n\nAnd it's okay, I've made my peace with it. I was waitlisted for Minnesota, but because of funding cuts, they sent me an email saying they can't admit a single waitlisted student into the program. And both UChicago and Michigan offered me a partially-funded Master's degree instead of a PhD, but as I am an international student with a limited budget (and extremely strict parents), I've had to turn them down.\n\nI am still extremely grateful to have received these offers in the first place, and I hope that whoever gets the freed spots absolutely flourishes. It's just really upsetting that things ended up this way - that my admissions to universities were turned down because of something completely out of my control. I just thought I had hope of being one of the few people to do something really difficult, and the first woman in my family to get a PhD (this early, anyway - I am definitely still planning on pursuing that).\n\nSo instead I will be staying at my current university to do my Master's. I would have no problem with this if I wasn't worried it would look unimpressive on my transcript (apparently admission boards don't like it if you do both degrees at the same university), but I genuinely don't have another choice. And it's not like the program at my home university is bad, either; I just wish I had better news to share with my friends and the professors who believed in me. \n\nAnyway, this is moreso a rant than anything else.

    "body": "Hi everyone! This summer has been going by quickly, and we’re only two to three months from Ph.D. applications opening back up. When I applied last year, it was around this time that I buckled in and started to take the process seriously. Looking back, I highly recommend starting your writing process in August—the more time you give yourself, the happier you’ll be with your final application!\n\nI was fortunate to have a successful cycle as a first-time applicant to biological/biomedical sciences Ph.D. programs in the US, despite the insanity that plagued the admissions process. I applied to \\~11 programs, received interview invites from 10 (I turned down 2 because I was overwhelmed), got 7 offers, and was waitlisted post-interview from the last one. Just to briefly share my “stats” ***(which I don’t think matter nearly as much as the written statements and LORs)***: I majored in Molecular Biology with minors in Chemistry and Math from a T100 R1 school with a 3.7 GPA. I took 2 gap years for an NIH post-bacc, so I had a little over 2 years of full-time research experience when I applied. No publications, just two posters.\n\nOkay! On to the advice!\n\nBefore you begin writing, there are three questions you need to be able to answer because they will come up in some way, shape, or form at least fifty times this cycle:\n\n* **Why do you want to get a Ph.D. in \\[insert field here\\]?** \n   * You have to be able to convince the admissions committee that you **need** a Ph.D. to achieve your career goal. If they believe, even for a second, that you could maybe accomplish this with a master’s or just more work experience, they’ll give the spot to a person who demonstrates the need for a doctorate\n   * *For example, professors and senior R&D scientists in industry or government (and other scientific leadership positions) are generally understood to “require” a Ph.D., while there’s a little more ambiguity about whether consultants and clinical researchers must have a Ph.D.*\n* **What do you want to study in graduate school?**\n   * **Keep it broad.** The narrower your research interests are, the harder it is to convince a program to let you in (this is a part of fit, which we’ll get into later). If your research interests are super narrow and only one P.I. is working in that area, they probably won’t let you in. Why? Well, what happens if that P.I. isn’t accepting students, or you don’t get along with them? Will you even consider working with someone else? Would you even stay in the program?\n   * **These are all very valid concerns for an admissions committee trying to figure out who should be in their rotation cohort**\n   * If you’re interested in a specific pathway implicated in cancer, instead of saying “I want to study XYZ pathway”, you can say “**I hope to study protein-protein (or protein-nucleic acid) interactions that are implicated in disease.”**\n   * Don’t get bogged down by the technique or the system you want to study! But you can add more details depending on the type of program you are applying to. For instance, if it’s a more translational program, I would mention something about targeting those interactions therapeutically.\n   * **Make it clear WHY you have these interests**, and this is where your past research experience usually comes into play: how have the projects you’ve worked on shaped your interests?\n* **What makes you qualified for graduate school?**\n   * So the obvious answer is that a Ph.D. is a research degree, and since I have research experience, I’m qualified to pursue one. \n   * But what you need is **meaningful research experience**. And a decent amount of it. This means that you had a) **some degree of independence** (it was your hypothesis, your technique, or just a question you asked and answered in a predefined project), b) **you learned something** (not how to pipet, but you learned something about the project, the field, and yourself as a scientist), and c) t**here was some sort of outcome** like a poster/abstract, a paper (it does NOT have to be a paper, I was unpublished when I got into Harvard), or a talk. **Make sure you are proactive during your research journey: if you want to go to a conference or present, talk to your advisor about it!**\n   * See how none of what I just said has anything to do with anything technical? **That’s the sort of mindset you need to get into as you start working on your application** – anyone can run a gel or take fluorescent reads, but not a lot of people can communicate their work and its significance to a broad audience, formulate their questions or hypotheses, and design experiments to test those hypotheses. Those are the things that make you qualified for graduate study!\n\nWe talk about \"fit\" on here a lot, and sometimes it can be unclear what that means, especially when it isn't defined by the poster or commenter. In the context of this post**, fit is the applicant’s potential to succeed in the program and contribute meaningfully to that program through their research, academic, and social goals.** \n\n* **Research interests**: This is arguably the most important aspect of fit and it’s pretty boilerplate: is the research you want to do being done at this program? Note that I emphasized program – some programs will not let you rotate or do your dissertation research with faculty they have not appointed, so make sure you do your due diligence on the people you want to work with. It is best practice to look at faculty within the department/program regardless of their rotation policy with external faculty. This shows that you are invested in that specific program!\n   * The general rule of thumb is that you need to identify at least three faculty members with research interests that align with yours. If you can’t do that, it’s not a good program fit for you: move on. *(Don’t read every single paper of every faculty member of interest! Fun fact: I didn’t read a single one!)*\n   * If you find that dozens of programs don’t have at least three faculty members with your interests, your research interests are too specific for a rotation program: make them broader and re-evaluate or consider applying direct-admit.\n* **Research Resources**: If your research goal is to identify druggable-target systems, you’ll need a program that has a robust structural biology core (think the SLAC at Stanford) or is a part of a consortium that uses specific cores (like Brookhaven National Labs). You may also need a high-throughput screening facility or ready access to one.\n* **Program Structure/Culture**: This is something that a lot of people don’t think about (I certainly didn’t until I started working in a lab with graduate students!), but not all Ph.D. programs are created equal. Some programs require eight consecutive semesters of coursework while others only require two semesters. Some schools have flexible curriculums with minimal core requirements while others have a rigid class schedule with few opportunities to take electives.\n   * This may be a little further down the line, but the format of preliminary qualifying exams (“prelims”, “quals”) is also something that will affect you. Do you want to take it earlier in your graduate career or later? Would you be okay with an off-topic exam or an on-topic exam that directly relates to your dissertation work?\n   * Some programs emphasize a supportive, collaborative training environment with lots of guidance from a variety of offices (DEI, academic tutoring, etc.) whereas other programs don’t really have those mechanisms of support – think carefully of what type of training environment you would thrive in!\n* **Career Resources**: Remember that your goal after getting your Ph.D. is to get your dream job. Let’s say that you want to go on and become tenured faculty: Does the program allow Ph.D. students to or require them to teach? Does the program encourage students to write grants (e.g., NSF GRFP, NIH F31, HHMI Gilliam)? Is there an emphasis on scientific communication?\n   * These are all resources that will help you accomplish your goal of becoming a faculty member at a university someday and you need to make sure that the programs you are interested in have those resources!\n   * If you want to work in industry look for programs with networking and mentorship services for graduate students with industry professionals, translational medicine certificates, student organizations centered around start-up/innovation/entrepreneurship culture.\n   * That’s a lot to think about. Luckily, most of this information can be found on the program website, faculty profiles/lab websites, and graduate student handbooks. I also recommend writing this down in a Word document for when you’re actually applying (it made my life SO much easier when I was personalizing my SOPs). You will eventually need to narrow down your school list by September or October (*depending on how flexible your recommenders are, you can probably get away with some adjustments in November*).\n   * I can’t tell you how many schools you should apply to – that depends on your financial situation, recommenders willingness to fill out several forms, and your tolerance of filling out these applications (trust me, it can get very annoying, very quickly). All I can say is, with the current climate surrounding research, you **may need to consider casting a wider net than what was recommended in the past (15+ programs).**\n\n* **Letters of recommendation** are one of the most important aspects of your application (arguably more important than your grades and only slightly less important than your statement of purpose). The goal of this letter is for experts in your field (in other words, your faculty mentors) to inform other experts in your field (the admissions committee) that you will make meaningful, original contributions to their field once you are finished training.\n\n   * Therefore, it’s **critical** that your recommenders emphasize your ability to work as an independent scientist who is capable of problem solving, thinking creatively, asking your scientific questions, and, most importantly, being trainable. They are in the unique position to speak about your past as a trainee and how you most likely will be a trainee in a Ph.D. program.\n   * Whenever you have a research experience (whether it be as a technician, intern, or post-bacc), make sure you establish a good working relationship with your principal investigator. Ask to meet regularly or semi-regularly, take time to discuss your academic and career goals, and share things that are important to you as a person and scientist. When you leave the experience, keep them updated on what you’re doing and what you plan to do soon.\n   * This makes it easier to ask for that letter of recommendation when the time comes. **When should you ask for a letter? Ideally, six to eight weeks before the letter deadline** (some applications have different, generally later, deadlines for letters of recommendation), but I would err on the side of eight weeks. Personally, **I think the best time to ask if right after Labor Day** since it gives most professors a chance to settle into the new school year before getting bombarded with letter requests.\n\nThe hardest (and most crucial) part of your application is the statement of purpose. The goal of this document is to concisely tell the Ph.D. admissions committee why you are applying for a Ph.D. – What are you interested in studying in grad school, why are you interested in studying this? What do you plan to do after, and how is that program uniquely qualified to help you accomplish your academic, research, and career goals?\n\nYou have roughly 1200 words to touch on each of those things so every word counts.\n\nThe SoP can be broken down into three big chunks:\n\n**Introduction**\n\n* **The introduction to your statement (or anywhere in your statement) is not the time to wax poetic** about how you fell in love with science in elementary school. It’s not the time to share that you want a Ph.D. in neuroscience because you want to find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease which runs in your family.\n* Those and other personal reasons are all great reasons to pursue a Ph.D. in a biological science, but **the admissions committee doesn’t care (at least nine times out of ten) and typically it doesn’t come off as impactful as the writer intends for it to be**. We can share (cautiously) more personal reasons in the personal statement.\n* They are looking for a tangible, measurable, and reasonable reason for pursuing a doctoral degree. Just because you like science doesn’t mean you’ll feel motivated to finish a very difficult degree like a Ph.D. and, likewise, you may learn in grad school that it’s not easy to cure Alzheimer’s – what will keep you engaged with the science? What will keep you in the program?\n* I suggest writing a *brief* introduction (three sentences max) clearly stating your future career and research goals and state that you plan to achieve that goal with a PhD in XYZ field. Now, within the first thirty seconds of reading your statement, the reviewers knows exactly why you are applying for a Ph.D.\n\n**Research Experience**\n\n* **This is going to be the majority of your statement (\\~75%), so make it count.** If you have several research projects, I suggest picking two of the most relevant experiences and fleshing those out in detail. *(Note: If your program asks for a research statement in place of an SOP, it should adopt this format.)*\n* When you begin discussing your research, keep the narrative structure by setting up the experience before you get into the experimental details:\n   * When during your career did this experience occur? Was it in undergrad? Was it during your post-bacc or master's? Was it through an REU or other summer research program? Were you a tech? Did you receive some sort of award or fellowship to pursue this project? Where did it happen, and whose lab did you work in? What does the lab broadly do, and how did your specific research goal fit into the work this lab does? What previous work or data led to this goal? (use the AND, BUT, THEREFORE framework)\n   * By adopting this format, the reader can logically follow your research journey throughout the statement of purpose. If you decided to switch disciplines or systems, it’s easy to slide it into these short introductory sentences before delving into what you found.\n\nWhen you start to discuss your results, you need to make sure that it is not technical! This is where a lot of people begin to lose the admissions committee – **any scientist in any field should be able to understand your project from start to finish**, and a good way to test this is to have scientists outside of your lab read your statement and point out anything they don’t understand.\n\n* The best way to write your results is as a “mini-abstract” where you present what you did, *what you found*, and **what it told you**\n\n* Use the purpose of the experiment and not the experiment itself to demonstrate that you know why you did what you did.\n   * Western blot = measures protein expression\n   * EMSA/ITC/FA/SPR/BLI = tests binding affinity\n   * Cycloheximide chase = tests protein stability\n   * Co-immunoprecipitation = identifies protein-protein interactions\n* Take ownership and say “I” instead of “we”!\n\nBefore moving on to the next experience, make sure you share why your project is important for the field as a whole and to keep the narrative structure, you can also share any outcomes of the project (publications, posters, etc.) and how you grew as a scientist (first experience with benchwork, decided you really liked studying cardiovascular disease, etc.).\n\nWhen you transition into the next experience, make sure you loosely tie together those experiences in a way that makes logical sense. For example if you’re going from undergraduate research to some sort of post-bacc or master’s experience, explain briefly why you decided to pursue that experience instead of directly applying to graduate school and what you hoped to learn.\n\n**At the end of your final research experience, include a closing sentence that emphasizes how the experiences you’ve detailed inform what you want to pursue in graduate school.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* Start off by reminding the reader what you hope to study or accomplish in graduate school with the first sentence (likely just a rephrase of what you said in your introduction).\n* Transition into why this program is a good fit for you (not just research-wise! **mention how the program’s structure or curriculum, or required scientific activities, etc., make that specific program a perfect match**)\n* Tell the program who you can see yourself working with and why. Is it because you worked on something similar beforehand? Are you interested in taking a new approach to the same system? **(Remember to keep it brief and general and mention at least 3 PIs)**\n* Be sure to include other things about the program that you like! If you are interested in scientific outreach, mention that you can’t wait to mentor high school students in your thesis lab through a specific program. If you want to be faculty one day, talk more about your interest in their teaching fellowships.\n* **Have a strong concluding sentence that emphasizes your commitment to that program’s academic community.**\n\nSorry for the lengthy post, but I wanted to be as thorough as possible! I only touched on the LORs and the SOPs, but I'm happy to answer any questions about staying organized/my timeline, my personal statements, CV, or expand on any of the points I made above. I can also talk about my interview process, but maybe when the cycle gets closer to interview season! Like with all advice, this is anecdotal from my experience - I understand that **graduate school admissions is not one-size-fits-all** and something that worked for me, may not have worked for others and vice versa!"

Not surprising, and  I think it’s pretty clear the same thing is happens at the high school level, too. It’ll be interesting to see how things shake out. \n\nETA Full Text: \n\nTHE PERVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF THE EASY A\n\nIn the era of grade inflation, students at top colleges are more stressed than ever.\n\nAUGUST 28, 2025\nDuring their final meeting of the spring 2024 semester, after an academic year marked by controversies, infighting, and the defenestration of the university president, Harvard’s faculty burst out laughing. As was tradition, the then-dean of Harvard College, Rakesh Khurana, had been providing updates on the graduating class. When he got to GPA, Khurana couldn’t help but chuckle at how ludicrously high it was: about 3.8 on average. The rest of the room soon joined in, according to a professor present at the meeting.\n\nThey were cracking up not simply because grades had gotten so high but because they knew just how little students were doing to earn them.\n\nLast year, the university set out to study the state of academics at Harvard. The Classroom Social Compact Committee released its report in January. Students’ grades are up, but they’re doing less academic work. They skip class at a rate that surprises even the most hardened professors. Many care more about extracurriculars than coursework. “A majority of students and faculty we heard from agree that Harvard College students do not prioritize their academic experience,” the committee wrote.\n\nAnd yet, these students report being more stressed about school than ever. Without meaningful grades, the most ambitious students have no straightforward way to stand out. And when straight A’s are the norm, the prospect of getting even a single B can become terrifying. As a result, students are anxious, distracted, and hyper-focused on using extracurriculars to distinguish themselves in the eyes of future employers.\n\nOf course, plenty of Harvard students are still devoted to their schoolwork, and rampant grade inflation is not unique to any one college. It affects all of elite academia. But Harvard is a useful case study because administrators have examined the issue, and because as goes Harvard, so goes the rest of the sector. \n\nAnd now Harvard is, at long last, embarking on an effort to reverse the trend and make its programming more academically rigorous. In doing so, it’s confronting a question that would be absurd if it weren’t so urgent: Can the world’s top universities get their students to care about learning?\n\nThe road to grade-inflation hell was paved with good intentions. As more students applied to Harvard and earning a spot became ever harder, the university ended up filling its classes with students who had only ever gotten perfect grades. \n\nThese overachievers arrived on campus with even more anxiety than past generations about keeping up their GPA. Students sobbing at office hours, begging their professor to bump a rare B+ to an A–, became a not-uncommon occurrence.\nAt the same time, professors were coming under more pressure to tend to their students’ emotional well-being, Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard’s dean of undergraduate education, told me. They received near-constant reminders that Harvard was admitting more students with disabilities, who’d matriculated from under-resourced schools, or who had mental-health issues. Instructors took the message as an exhortation to lower expectations and raise grades. Resisting the trend was hard. Few professors want to be known as harsh graders, with the accompanying poor evaluations and low course enrollments. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker told me that, 20 years ago, he gave a quarter of the students in his intro psych course an A or A–. Then students stopped signing up. Now almost two-thirds of the class are in the A range.\n\nThe pandemic only made matters worse. In 2011, 60 percent of all grades at Harvard were in the A range (up from 33 percent in 1985). By the 2020–21 academic year, that share had risen to 79 percent. Students were more anxious than ever, so professors further eroded norms to help them.\n\nTaken together, this has led to a regime in which most students get near-perfect grades, but the grades mean something different to everyone. Outside observers might still think of grades as an objective assessment of a student’s work, and therefore a way to differentiate between levels of achievement. But many professors seem to conceive of them as an endlessly adaptable participation trophy. Claybaugh recalled a recent talk with an experienced science professor who told her that some students get A’s for excellent work. Others get the mark because they’re from less-privileged backgrounds and demonstrated improvement throughout the semester. \n\nAnd still others get A’s because they were doing strong work before a mental-health crisis derailed their progress. “So pretty much everyone gets A’s,” Claybaugh told me. “That’s where we’ve ended up.”\nWithout the threat of poor grades, students have largely stopped trying in their courses. Pinker told me that student performance on the multiple-choice portion of his final exam (which he has kept mostly the same) has declined by 10 percentage points over the past two decades, even as he gives out more A’s. \n\nAn incoming Harvard junior, who requested anonymity to avoid affecting her future job prospects, told me that, for all the hand-wringing about student self-censorship, her peers mostly don’t read texts closely enough to form opinions in the first place. “I feel like college has become almost anti-intellectual,” Melani Cammett, a Harvard international-affairs professor, told me. “This is the place where we’re supposed to deal with big ideas, and yet students are not really engaging with them.”\n\nThat easy A’s would lead students to phone in their coursework should have been predictable. What’s genuinely surprising is that the system has also failed to reduce stress. The percentage of first-year students who have received counseling has nearly tripled in the past decade. This tension nagged at me during my own time in college. I graduated from Yale two years ago. While there, I experienced many of the same dynamics that Harvard professors and students described to me. The classes were mostly easy. Hardly anyone did the reading. We could all expect to be rewarded with an A or, at the very worst, a B. And yet students were always panicking. It felt at times as though campus was in the throes of a collective psychotic break. It wasn’t until I graduated that I, like Harvard’s professors and administrators, came to see these issues—lax grading, high stress—as connected.\n\nWhen everyone gets an A, an A starts to mean very little. The kind of student that gets admitted to Harvard (or any elite college) wants to compete. They’ve spent their lives clawing upward. Khurana, the former dean, observed that Harvard students want success to feel meaningful. \n\nGetting all A’s is necessary, but insufficient.\n\nThis has created what Claybaugh called a “shadow system of distinction.” Students now use extracurriculars to differentiate themselves from their peers. They’ve created a network of finance and consulting clubs that are almost indistinguishable from full-time jobs. To apply, students submit résumés, sit for interviews, and prepare a fake case or deliverable. At this point, the odds of getting into some clubs within Harvard are similar to the odds of being accepted to the college in the first place. The Harvard junior told me that she hadn’t considered going into consulting or investment banking before she arrived in Cambridge. But because the clubs are so exclusive, everyone wants to be chosen. She ended up applying. “There are a handful of clubs that you can just join, but the clubs people want to join are typically not the clubs everyone can join,” she told me. “Even volunteering clubs or service-oriented clubs have an application process. They’re highly competitive.” Things have gotten to the point where some students feel guilty for focusing on schoolwork at the expense of extracurriculars, she told me.\n\nMax Palys, an incoming Harvard senior, told me that coursework doesn’t prepare students to answer interview questions for finance and consulting jobs. The only way to get ready is through extracurriculars or on one’s own time. By sophomore year, his friends were fully absorbed in the internship-recruiting process. They took the easiest classes they could find and did the bare-minimum coursework to reserve time to prepare for technical interviews.\n\nThis hypercompetitive club culture advantages students who come from fancy high schools. Maya Jasanoff, a history professor and a co-chair of the Classroom Social Compact Committee, pointed out that Harvard devotes considerable resources to helping less-privileged students succeed academically. But that kind of assistance is useless to the extent that extracurricular clubs, which prioritize students who already have experience, are the coin of the realm.\n\nNow that they know that making college easier doesn’t reduce stress, Harvard administrators are attempting to rediscover a morsel of lost wisdom from the ancient past: School should be about academics. In March, the faculty amended the student handbook to emphasize the highly novel point that students should prioritize their schoolwork. The university has advised professors to set attendance policies and make clear that students, contrary to their intuition, are expected to come to class. And it formed a new committee to consider how to rein in runaway grade inflation. The committee is considering proposals such as switching from letter grades to a numerical scale (to get rid of students’ frame of reference) or reporting grades as the difference between what a student earned and the course median. In the meantime, Claybaugh has asked each department to standardize and toughen its grading policies. Faculty will need to move collectively so no one gets singled out as a harsh grader.\n\nFixing grade inflation, however, is easier said than done. Princeton, for example, experimented with an informal 35 percent cap on the share of A’s that professors were expected to give out. It abandoned the effort after a 2014 faculty report found, among other things, that the policy made it harder to recruit students, particularly student athletes. Beginning in 1998, Cornell began including courses’ median grades on student transcripts. Far from mitigating grade inflation, the practice only made the problem worse by giving students extra insight into which classes were the easiest. Last year, the faculty senate voted to end the policy.\n\nClaybaugh assured me that Harvard is committed to bringing about a lasting culture change around learning. She thinks of the change as a matter of fairness. Harvard students have access to a trove of intellectual treasures and the chance to commune with many of the greatest living minds. “If we have the world’s biggest university library, then our students should be reading these books,” Claybaugh told me. “And if the students we’re admitting don’t want to read those books, or if we have set up an incentive structure that dissuades them from reading these books, then that is immoral, and we need to reincentivize them to do so.”\n\nIf Harvard is to succeed where Princeton and Cornell failed, it will be because the political environment has given its initiative an extra level of urgency. The Trump administration’s assault on elite institutions generally and Harvard in particular has put the university’s public standing at stake. Claybaugh believes that the best way to help Harvard is to acknowledge its flaws and try to fix them. Bringing rigor back to the academic mission seems a natural place to start. “We should be making sure that we are living up to our mission to restore our legitimacy in people’s eyes,” she told me. “I don’t want people all across America thinking, It’s a place of ideas I find somehow troubling or offensive, and also, no one goes to class.”\n\nRose Horowitch is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\nDavid A.

The journey typically takes 4 years of undergraduate study, followed by 4 years of medical school, then 3-7 years of residency training.\n\nNow if you're seriously considering pursing medicine, I would recommend looking into BS/MD or BS/DO programs. Remember MDs and DOs are both physicians, DO schools generally have lower stat req's to get into.\n\nIf you want to find more about what being premed really is, I would look at [https://premeder.com](https://premeder.com) to know more about what being premed really is, you can also see all of the BS/MD, and BS/DO schools."

    "body": "I feel the biggest regret of my twenties was choosing the wrong school. I was studying in the U.S. and had been admitted to two universities ranked 21 and 96 in the U.S. News world rankings. Because of how I thought back then, I couldn’t bear to leave my friends, so I stayed in my original city and chose the school ranked 96. In my early twenties I didn’t pay much attention to rankings, but now I feel I was naive. Many of those friends have since drifted away; only a few close friends remain. As a Chinese person, I know that academic rankings are highly valued in China, better degrees usually bring a competitive advantage (Of course, networking and background are more important). Students who return from schools ranked in the top 50 often receive government subsidies and other benefits, while those from lower-ranked schools get far fewer advantages. Studying abroad is very expensive, and the tuition at the school ranked 96 was about the same as at the one ranked 21. Looking back, I regret not putting those funds to better use.\n\nChinese society is extremely competitive and nearly all of my peers applied to graduate school. Having a master’s degree is now nearly essential for many jobs. Because of my undergraduate experience, I worked very hard when applying for grad school and got a good result I was admitted to Columbia University in New York. But in the first month of my graduate program I developed depression. I felt like a machine and suddenly became very lost. I also had trouble adjusting to life in New York, so I decided to take a temporary leave and return to China. During my leave I tried some jobs I enjoyed and did things I liked, and I did grow a bit. Time flew — I have to return next month to finish my degree but now I’m indecisive. I realize those years of youth are short: I’m already 27, and if I go back and finish I’ll be 28–29. I’m starting to feel anxious about my age. Most friends my age are already working or chasing their careers. Also, my current girlfriend is in China. She’s a wonderful girl and someone worth marrying. If I go back to the U.S. for 1.5 to 2 years to study, the long-distance relationship will greatly affect our relationship, and there’s a high chance we might break up. I never thought I would meet someone like her before going abroad, yet it happened this very year when I’m about to leave. I feel very conflicted. Columbia’s graduate program is expensive, graduating will cost at least $120,000–$160,000. With that money I could buy a brand-new nice sports car outright, or I could invest it in a business that might bring better returns. Is earning a master’s degree from a top school really worth it? I can’t clearly see which path is best for my future. I would really appreciate advice from someone more experienced. Thank you for taking the time to read what I wrote.\n\n"

    "body": "Hi guys! I just wanted to provide an update on my college decisions from earlier this year and say thank you to the people who have helped me so far! The whole college decision process has been really tough  mentally and it's been hard not to compare my situation with others, but I'm really starting to get excited about the fall! If anyone wants to give more advice to my situation, I would love to hear it! Also feel free to DM me about personal questions!\n\nI didn't end up staying on the waitlist at Colby, Johns Hopkins, and Boston College, and I chose to remain on the waitlist for Cornell, UPenn, Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Williams, and Amherst. I made a post earlier this year about being waitlisted at all of these places if you've seen it! My final commitment decision was between Colgate University (\\~100k/year with no financial aid and into their Alumni Memorial Scholars program), Lafayette College (\\~50k/year with their Marquis Scholarship), and UConn (\\~20k/year with their scholarship for Valedictorians and Salutatorians). I ended up committing to Lafayette, and I'm really excited! I *loved* Colgate, but we couldn't afford it and even after we met with the financial aid office, we were unable to get any offers. UConn offered me a great scholarship but I think I would more so enjoy going to a smaller campus for undergrad.\n\nMost of the Ivy League waitlists right now have emailed me saying they were full, so I'm not expecting anything (but if they move I'll be thrilled)! I haven't heard anything from Princeton though, so I'm unsure whether to interpret this as a good or bad sign this late in the game. I did LOCIs/updates for all of them for reference. I have no connections to any of these places.\n\nAlso for reference for those wanting to know, I'm from a wealthy town and go to one of the best public schools in my state. I'm in a class of \\~200 kids and we have \\~5 students this year going to Ivy League colleges. I'm female, white, and applied for financial aid because I have younger twin brothers who are planning to go to college in four years. With rising college tuition rates and my hope to go to graduate school at the same time as my brothers' undergraduate, it would be really strenuous to our family to pay off debt on top of 3 children being enrolled in school. I'm also the Salutatorian for that high school class and want to go into some sort of science (I like every science subject so it was really difficult for me to narrow it down!).\n\nI've always been someone who does a lot of activities, so I would say in the application process, I was more of a well-rounded candidate compared to a specialized one. This is kind of why I'm excited to go to Lafayette: I'll be able to explore the areas I want without being restricted by having to be inside a certain college to take courses. I also think I'll be able to focus on a long-term goal that I've had, which is to start/own my own business on top of pursuing a STEM career! Because my family is able to afford my college, I can start this summer on prototypes and branding instead of working extensively. I have a lot of goals, so I'm really excited that this is the next step for me and it seems like a less stressful atmosphere than going to an Ivy League. I think this is a good thing, as I can choose what I want to do with my time and buckle down on goals. Please DM me if you would like any more info.\n\nSome part of me thinks that all of these waitlists happened for a reason. It's really easy to get bogged down because I didn't get in at my top choices, but I also didn't get rejected *anywhere* this year. It sucks that I might not be going to a T20 like a bunch of my friends are, but maybe this was the decision that makes the most sense for me! I've met a few people going to Lafayette so far this year and I'm really excited because they were really nice, and I've heard what a great job the faculty does at getting students involved. There's also always graduate school for an Ivy League, and I'm hoping there will be more opportunities in four years for scientific research in the US than there are now. :) \n\nIf anyone has any questions or any advice for me on my next steps, I would love to hear it!"

This is a bit long so I apologize in advance.\n\nI applied to seven programs in developmental psychology. I got an interview at UCLA, which I'm over the moon over - it was incredibly validating (and dare I say flattering) to feel like someone actually read my application and thought I was \"good enough\" to talk to about my research interests and how passionate I am about the work I do. I cannot say the same for the rest of this process.\n\nMy first rejection was from UNC Chapel Hill. It stung a bit, but I figured maybe it's just a poor program fit. It's a numbers game, after all, so whatever. Then a few nights ago, I decided to refresh my UChicago portal (I applied for Comparative Human Development, so not *really* psychology, but as someone with an interdisciplinary background I thought it would be a good fit) because being neurotic is the default when you're waiting for news, and there it was. Rejected. No email, no notification to check my portal, just quietly sitting there like a landmine waiting to ruin my night.\n\nI know for a fact I'm good enough. I've done the work, I've found my passion after changing my academic focus, and I'm proud of myself. I helped co-found the LGBTQ+ alumni board at my undergraduate university. I volunteer at the local animal shelter. 3.84 undergrad GPA, 3.96 post-bac GPA. 1 published article (sole author). It's hardly a matter of me not trying.\n\nAt first, I felt completely crushed. I kept thinking things like: why did I bother? Why did I spend a year and half chasing new research opportunities? Why did I spend so much time refining my CV and SOP all for this? It's so demoralizing and dejecting to feel like none of it matters. This whole process has made me feel like my view of myself and how proud I am of how far I've come is irrelevant. All that matters is how some admissions committee, behind their opaque and inscrutable process, chooses to see me. I'm left here in the dark trying to figure out what the hell I did wrong.\n\nThe UChicago rejection really frustrated me. I checked Gradcafe (because who doesn't) and they're rejecting people with multiple published papers, people with many years of research experience in their field, they even rejected someone with nearly 100k euros in research grants (different field but still). I have to wonder, who the actual fuck are they accepting? How is it possible that people whose entire lives are dedicated to their fields aren't \"good enough\"? The opacity of these decisions is maddening. There's no feedback, no transparency, nothing. Just a quiet little rejection like \"we appreciate your time and effort applying to our program and spending $80 you'll never get back\" sitting in a portal that we had to refresh on our own because they don't even have the decency to send me an email.\n\nIt's honestly insulting. How are we supposed to make sense of this process? How are we supposed to feel anything but powerless when we pour everything into our applications? I know this process is competitive, and I know rejection is a part of it... but it's so hard not to feel like none of us ever stood a chance.\n\nThanks for reading my rant. I know we're all in this together and it seriously breaks my heart to see how many talented, passionate people are being treated like this. I hope we all end up where we're supposed to in the end. <3"

This was my top choice, and I really admired the work of one researcher in particular. Not only did I get to interview him, I found the others in the committee really welcoming. It was a great experience, but very soon after, I got in my head that not having a Master's would be a big disadvantage. Cue the cancellation of one of the interviews for a program I'd also wanted to pursue and had been invited to amid the whole mess going on, I honestly felt hopeless.\n\nAnd then... I got an email asking if I had time to call. Even though I was in class I left just to respond and waited a few hours of self-torture thinking of all the things that might be wrong. Nothing, in fact, was wrong- I got in!!!! The chair called me saying she wanted to convince me to choose them... I literally couldn't believe it. Apparently the committee reviewing my application voted unanimously to admit me and so they made the call literally a month earlier than I expected to hear back. Meeting later with this researcher that I have literally described as my role model to several people irl, who said he would love to work with me, was probably the best part. I had actually been accepted to another program the same day, and my first thought when I was told I had a week to respond (non US program) was that I hadn't heard back from my top choice 😭.\n\nI just accepted the formal offer today, and I'm literally overjoyed.

These 2 schools would make for an entirely differently undergraduate experience.\n\nHopkins  \nPros:  \n\\-flexibility to switch to other careers (if I didn't go med, I'd 100% do smth in med field)  \n\\-rigorous med school preparation  \n\\-amazing research and community opportunities, med school is amazing  \n\\-id meet amazing people  \n\\-world-class professors and education  \n\\-id grow a lot as a person and as a future doctor  \n\\-more diversity  \n\\-prestige (esp for all things med)  \n\\-leaving home (I want to get out of Indiana)  \nCons:  \n\\-268k over 4 years  \n\\-dangerous area  \n\\-cutthroat, toxic environment  \n\\-school largely premed  \n\\-no guarantee of med school  \n\\-most people at Hopkins premed take a gap year (9 years total education)  \n\\-stress of applying to med school  \n\\-will be so busy, won't have much time for hobbies  \n\\-social scene \n\nIUI BSMD  \nPros:  \n\\-guaranteed med school  \n\\-7 year accelerated timeline  \n\\-less stress applying to med school  \n\\-Indianapolis has many medical centers for opportunities  \n\\-IU med school is t42ish med school (t2 research + t3 primary care), even if I went to hopkins I may still attend IU med for the in-state tuition  \n\\-I want to be a cardiologist (but not set in stone) so internal medicine residency isn't as competitive as other residencies so no need for super prestigious med school  \n\\-more time to focus on hobbies  \n\\-can explore other interests like Spanish/business  \n\\-I can actually have time to grind pickleball and tennis  \n\\-tightknit cohort of 25 ppl  \n\\-graduate college and med school very low debt -> 36k total over 3 years after scholarships  \n\\-stay close to home so I can continue shadowing this doctor I look up to and giving tennis lessons\n\nCons:  \n\\-I wanted to leave indiana  \n\\-lack of undergrad prestige (admittedly I do care a bit about undergrad prestige as college is some of the most influential years of life and I want to spend it somewhere good)  \n-not even IU main campus, it's a satellite campus of mostly commuters\n\\-locked into IU med for med school (not bad bc IU med is good but wont be able to shoot my shot for those top free med schools like jhu nyu)  \n\\-won't be around as many individuals who will push me to succeed as jhu might  \n\\-iui is mostly a commuter school so social scene is also sort of dead from what I hear"

Over the past two years, we have already grown our enrollment percentage from 11 to 16 percent.\nWe are one of the few universities that meets 100 percent of the demonstrated need of every admitted student.\n\nThe Tufts Tuition Pact continues our longstanding efforts to minimize the need for undergraduate student loans by increasing financial aid scholarships and grants. As a result of the more than $143 million of undergraduate financial aid that the university provides annually, the average amount of student debt post-graduation from Tufts is under $15,000, significantly less than the nationwide average of nearly $40,000.

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently a neuroscience PhD student at a university in Japan. I’ve been in my current lab for 6 years (including undergrad research), and I’m now 4 years into the PhD program. Lately, I’ve been seriously considering quitting and reapplying to PhD programs in the US or UK due to ongoing issues with my advisor and lab environment.\n\nTo be blunt, I’m exhausted. My advisor requires me to write every detail of his conference presentations — slides, scripts, everything — and he barely engages until he reviews and nitpicks it a week later. I’ve also been made to fact-check and review drafts of his popular science books, and take calls during evenings and weekends with no boundaries. While I’ve managed to endure this so far, the final straw is this: our lab typically has a publication cycle of 3–4 years, and although I have a co–first-author paper currently in revision at Nature, he’s insisting I publish an additional paper before I can graduate. That’s not realistic for me, and it’s led me to think seriously about starting over elsewhere once the paper is published.\n\nI'm now considering applying to neuroscience PhD programs in the US or UK. (Most EU programs are not an option since I don’t have a master’s degree.)\n\nMy main concerns:\n\nMy undergraduate GPA is 3.33/4.00 — not terrible, but not particularly competitive.\n\nGiven my advisor’s strong opposition to me leaving (he tends to treat students as if he \"owns\" them — even trying to control our postdoc destinations, and has frequently threatened to withhold graduation if we don't comply with his demands), I likely won’t be able to get a letter of recommendation from him or other faculty I’ve worked closely with during my PhD, as he tends to exert pressure on colleagues to prevent them from supporting students who go against his wishes.\n\nI’m currently considering:\n\nA professor from an undergrad course I took 4 years ago, but i had quite good relationship with him. But I haven't contacted with him since.\n\nA professor I briefly collaborated with on a joint project\n\nPossibly a postdoc who graduated from my current lab\n\n\n\nI know LORs carry a lot of weight in applications, and I’m still struggling to figure out who I can reasonably ask for a letter.\n\nGiven this situation, do I have a realistic shot at being admitted to a top-tier PhD program in the US or UK in neuroscience? Any advice would be deeply appreciated — especially around how to frame my situation and make the most of what I do have.\n\nThanks in advance!"

I had been so confident that I'd be accepted somewhere that when I got rejected from every program I'd applied to I was completely emotionally unprepared. \n\nI took some time to emotionally recover, but I didn't give up. I finished my undergraduate degree strong, presented at more conferences, and continued doing good research. After graduating I got hired by two non-profits in mental health and committed to that work. I spent all summer investigating programs, emailing potential PIs, and drafting my application materials. This time I applied to nine Clinical Psychology programs across Canada. (In retrospect this was a waste - only two of these programs would have been an excellent fit. I wanted to give myself the best chance of getting in, but my advice now would be to just pour all your resources into the programs you're a shoe-in for!)\n\nI had no idea what to expect. Since December 1st I've alternated between feeling hopeful and absolutely dejected. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw in mid-January that I'd been invited to interview at my top choice program. I practiced with my partner and my lab mates, and made sure I understood the research of everyone on the interview panel. The interviews went suspiciously well - I couldn't figure out if that meant they really did go off without a hitch, or if I was so far off course that I bombed without knowing it. \n\nThat was a month ago, and on February 11th I received word from my PI that he was recommending me for admission to the program. I sobbed. Hard. Then I called my partner, my mom, my friends, and it started to settle in. I'M GOING TO BE A GRADUATE STUDENT! I'm going to my top choice program to do research that makes my heart sing, and to learn therapeutic skills that will allow me to work with the populations I most want to serve. I still can hardly believe it. Like the title says - I've been jumping for joy while walking the dog, and whenever I think about this I start beaming. \n\nI know this cycle has been hard on many of us, especially those in the U.S. I know that an acceptance is an incredible privilege, and that part of this was luck. I hope that my story gives you hope if you end up being where I was last year. Don't give up. Keep pursuing your dreams, even if that means making adjustments. The world needs good, passionate people doing what they are best at. \n\nStat tax: \n\n4.27/4.33 GPA, 3 yrs combined experience in a research lab, 3 x first author pubs (1 submitted to major journal, 2 published in student journal), 1 x second author pub (submitted to major journal), 1 x first author poster pub, 5 x conference posters, 1 yr outreach volunteering, 2 mos clinical experience \n\n "

    "body": "Wow, this is exciting!  You just got the glossy mailer inviting you to apply to a *very prestigious* summer camp!  And it will be held at an Ivy!  With real, live Ivy ^(affiliated) professors teaching it!  Surely if you can somehow scrape together the low five figures they're asking for, this will all but cement your admission to that same school or other T20s come senior year...right?\n\nThe no-longer-secret truth about these programs is that they won't really help your application to a top 20 college.  And that's good news for most of us.  Quite often, the selection criteria for these programs is primarily (or even totally) driven by your ability to pay for them - I've taken to calling them **\"Summer Paygrams.\"**  They admit the vast majority of applicants, and do not typically offer opportunities and experiences that admissions offices will regard as distinctive or compelling.  It's quite possible for your parents to sign you up for one of these, and for you to go through the motions doing the bare minimum as a warm body in the room.  There may be no initiative, leadership, or even effort or engagement on your part.  And for some students, that's part of the draw - they get something they think looks good on their resume without much work or thoughtful planning, and it's a lot easier than blazing your own trail.  At the end of the day, there's very little impact to your college application, which is in direct contradiction to the biggest reason I've seen students and parents interested in these.  If you're a very strong applicant to top colleges, then attending a summer paygram probably won't hold you back.  If you're not a strong applicant, a summer paygram probably won't make you into one.\n\n#Pros and Cons of Summer Paygrams\n\n**Pros**\n- It's all planned for you.  So you don't have a litany of decisions to make or accountabilities to hold yourself to.  You can relax and enjoy the structured program.\n- Exploration.  You'll get a chance to see a college campus, dive into some classes and activities related to the topic/theme of the camp, and meet some interesting people.\n- It's better than bingeing Netflix or playing video games in your mom's basement all summer.\n\n**Cons**\n- It's all planned for you.  And admissions officers know that you didn't really achieve much - you mostly just showed up. \n- Opportunity cost.  You often can't take on as many other opportunities with your summer, so you need to think carefully about whether this is on your list of things you really want to do.\n- Financial cost. Many of these are crazy expensive - I've seen some over $20K+.\n\n#The Difference Between Quality Programs And Cash-Grab Paygrams\n\n>*\"How do I find the good summer programs that are actually worthwhile and will actually help make my college applications stronger?*\n\nAt the bottom of this post, I've listed out many of the best summer programs and very high quality options.  I have a similar set of criteria for evaluating programs as MIT does, and these are a good way to assess any program's value, especially from a college admissions perspective.  There are many excellent programs that will not manage to fully meet all of these factors.  But these are the best criteria for assessing quality and value.   The best ones are:\n\n- **Free** - The best programs are free or offer generous need-based financial aid.  There is a very nearly inverse relationship between the cost of a program and the value it brings to your college application.  Many of the best programs will even offer stipends to cover incidental expenses.  Note that a program does not *have* to be free to be high quality, but if an expensive program doesn't offer need-based aid, that's usually a strong indication that it's a paygram.\n\n- **Selective** - Programs admitting more than 80% of their applicants tend to be significantly less valuable that those with admit rates below 20%.  These rates are not often published, but many programs will have some indication of selectivity, or they will have limiting eligibility requirements.\n\n- **Intellectually Compelling** - You should learn meaningful content, find your curiosity or inquisitiveness encouraged, and be given opportunities to explore material at a deeper level. \n\n- **Educationally Rigorous** - You should be challenged and held accountable for being fully engaged.  The best programs will mirror the rigor of undergraduate study.\n\n- **Community Driven** - They should intentionally foster a great community of like-minded peers and a student cohort that is interesting and inclusive.  Both the students and faculty should support the culture of learning & rigor, emphasis on interpersonal connection, community vibe, and communal enjoyment of sharing passion and geeking out over the subject together.  There should be opportunities to get to know other students, develop relationships, and continue discussions.  At the best programs, attendees tend to stay in touch afterward and even reconnect in college.\n\n- **Enriching** - You should walk away with a profound sense that the experience was worthwhile and that it deepened your interest and understanding of the subject matter.\n\n- **Fun** - This is your life, and you only get one.  You don't want to waste a summer slogging through something you hate or killing off any spark of interest in the topics or subjects you're exploring.  Good programs find ways to make the experience enjoyable, and most students are sad when it's over.\n\nIf you want to spot the worst programs and avoid borderline scams or costly mistakes, consider the opposite qualities to those listed above.  Programs which check too many off this list are probably not worthwhile:\n\n- **Expensive** - Little to no financial aid is offered, and the price tag is in the high four to low five figures.  Paygrams.\n\n- **Open Enrollment** - Many expensive paygrams will admit 80% or more of their applicants with some admitting anyone willing to pay.  This means enrolling some students who are unmotivated or unqualified. \n\n- **Intellectually Bland** - There are few if any opportunities for deeper engagement with the material and subject matter.  They simply push through the planned syllabus. \n\n- **Educationally Light** - The program and content are clearly catering to the lowest common denominator of admitted student, and that's not a high bar to clear.  Little to no material is presented at the college level and is instead simple and introductory.  Students' main responsibility is to show up rather than to demonstrate mastery, think critically, or apply the knowledge and skills they're learning.\n\n- **Siloed or Individualistic** - There is little community or culture to speak of.  Most students were sent by their parents and are just there to check the boxes.  Faculty are there to get through it and collect their paycheck. Opportunities for personal connection or continued discussions are limited or performative.\n\n-**Inert** - The goal is completion of the program, not a richer understanding of the subject, an engaging experience, or an enhanced skill set.\n\n- **Boring or Tedious** - The classes are dry and plodding.  Assigned exercises are geared toward regurgitating information rather than applying it in creative or innovative ways.  When the paygram finally ends, both the students and faculty are relieved.\n\n#FAQ\n\n>**How many selective summer programs should I apply to?**\n\nThis depends on how much time you have available, how competitive your application is, and how determined you are to land a spot at a good program.  Most of my strongest and most determined students apply to 8-15 programs, partially because most of the essays are substantially the same.  It also depends on how many programs you actually find interesting.\n\n>**Everyone knows these \"paygrams\" are a terrible value, especially for college admissions.  Why are you wasting time talking about this?**\n\nFirst, while it's no longer a secret, there are still hundreds of people who don't know or find out too late.  Below are some actual things parents have said to me during consultations:\n\n- \"Our daughter was admitted to a really great program this summer at Harvard, so obviously that's going to really boost her chances at Ivies.\"\n\n- \"This program sounds amazing, but not quite affordable - I just wanted your thoughts on whether it's worth financing it with a loan?\"\n\nSecond, the list of programs below will introduce many high quality options that may not be on most students' radar.  Check it out.\n\n>**\"Are the best and most selective summer programs worth applying for?  Will they actually strengthen my college application?  It seems like a lot of work.\"**\n\nThe best summer programs are absolutely worth it both because of the experience and opportunities and because top colleges recognize their value, rigor, selectivity, and distinction. There's a bit of chicken-and-egg to this because incredible students are more likely to get into top summer programs and also more likely to get into top colleges.  But the following examples of students I worked with aren't coincidental:\n\n1.  A student I worked with last year who attended SSP got into Harvard, 5 UCs (including UCLA & UC Berkeley, with Regents at 3 of them), and was offered a full ride from USC.  Her only rejection was Stanford.\n\n2.  One of our students this year who attended SSP is a finalist for multiple full ride scholarships and just got a likely letter (call) from Yale.\n\n3.  The last student we worked with who attended RSI was admitted to nine T20 colleges.\n\n4.  A few years ago we worked with a student who attended a highly selective medical research program.  Despite not being in the traditional \"top tier\" of applicants, they were admitted ED to Northwestern.\n\n5.  Our last student who attended BeaverWorks was admitted to 3 Ivies and 7 T20s.\n\n6.  Another way to consider this - every student we've ever worked with who attended one of the programs listed below was admitted to one or more T20s.  That doesn't mean these are guarantees of admissions success, but it's not nothing.\n\n>**\"HELP!  I attended or am about to attend a paygram!  How can I make it worthwhile?\"**\n\nMany paygrams are fine for what they are - they just aren't going to materially improve your college application.  Some give you real college-level coursework or have elements that fall on both sides of the list of criteria I shared above.  If you're considering a paygram, the real question is whether you value the program itself and what you'll learn there enough, and whether you'll make the most of it.  But if all you're looking for is a way to boost your college applications, there are other things that would move the needle more.\n\nYou should consider these the way colleges will consider them, namely, that the impact and depth of engagement is what matters, not the fancy-sounding name brand or the fact that you were a warm body in a chair at a summer program for a few weeks.  Even an outstanding and selective program won't move the needle much if you aren't able to demonstrate that you learned, explored, achieved, created, etc.  And even the lesser programs could still be quite worthwhile if you really apply yourself and make an impact. \n\nSo for example, if your college application lists that you went to a quality program like MIT MITES, but doesn't share any details about what you learned, accomplished, or valued, it's not going to really change their assessment of you all that much.  But on the other hand, if you go to a low-profile, for-profit, open-enrollment (non-selective) coding camp and learn Ruby on Rails, BUT then use it to build a complex and impactful mobile app for an organization you're involved in, that would be a significant accomplishment.  It would show that you have a strong work ethic, take initiative, and own your education, using your skills to make a difference.  It would show that you can take responsibility, lead practically, learn meaningful things, and apply them.  As I've said before, the impact is what matters, not the hours, brand name, \"impressiveness,\" or presentation. \n\nAs it happens, the best, most selective, and highest quality summer programs are usually the ones that also provide the best opportunities for impact.  Many of the for-profit ones are more about going through the motions, checking boxes, and looking impressive than they are about actual impact.  No matter what kind of program you attend, I think the best things to do are:\n\n**1.  Approach it intentionally.**  Don't view this as merely an opportunity to get the \"Ivy+ brand\" listed on your resume.  Don't just show up and go through the motions.  Instead, be purposeful, engaged, and focused.\n\n**2.  Think about what you want out of the program, then look for opportunities for that.**  Are you looking to network with other students or profs?  Build a particular skill set?  Learn and explore more deeply into a particular topic? \n\n**3.  Find a way to independently apply something you did or learned in the program.**  Like the example I mentioned before, if you can take something you learned and then apply it on your own in a different setting or context, that's fantastic and would show that you truly got value out of the program and made the most of it.  You might not be able to say for sure what this would be or what it would look like beforehand.  But you should ask yourself, \"after I finish this program, what are the next steps?  Where do I go from here?  How do I build on this momentum?\"\n\n**4.  Worry less about how you might present or \"spin\" something, and more about what you really want to do.**  If you're pursuing things you love because you love them, then you don't need to spin that.  You can just be honest about who you are, what you love, and what you want to pursue.\n\nTo give you an example of why the above are important, top colleges obviously want students who are high-achieving academically and have demonstrated that they are fully capable.  BUT they despise the idea of pursuing strong grades or academic accolades as a rubber stamp of approval.  They are repulsed by the idea of a student doing something just because it will look good on a college application.  They want intellectual vitality - a persistent curiosity, engagement, and pursuit of topics and fields you love, not because you think they're impressive or anything, but simply because you love them.  They want sincere passion, deep interest, and exploration & learning for its own sake.\n\n#The Best Summer Programs\n\nBelow is my list of programs which, in my opinion, are high quality and have a lot to offer, especially from a college admissions perspective.  To varying degrees, they perform well against most or all of the criteria I listed above.  Check them out and put together your own list of the ones that are the most interesting to you.

Many of them are fantastic, but there may be a few in these lists that lean into the category of expensive, non-selective, go-thru-the-motions camps.  So use these lists to find the ones you're interested in, then do more research on those to determine if they meet the criteria outlined above (enriching, fun, selective, intellectually compelling, educationally rigorous, community driven, and are either free or offer generous need-based financial aid).\n\n•\tNational Conference of Governor's Schools Summer Programs:  https://www.ncogs.us/programs.html.  These are listed by state. \n\n•\tQuestBridge Summer Programs - These summer programs have partnered with QuestBridge to provide full funding for QuestBridge College Prep Scholars.  If you're eligible for QuestBridge (strong academics, <$65K household income, minimal assets), I HIGHLY recommend checking this out.  If you are not eligible for QuestBridge, it's still worth checking out their list of partner programs because many are fantastic.   https://www.questbridge.org/apply-to-college/programs/college-prep-scholars-program/scholarships-and-awards/summer-programs\n\n•\tMIT's list of year-round STEM programs & opportunities:  https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/stem/\n\n•\tDavidson Institute list of gifted summer programs:  Day Camps.  https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/gifted-summer-programs-day-camps/\n\n•\tDavidson Institute list of gifted summer programs:  Residential Programs.  https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/gifted-summer-programs-residential/\n\n•\tDavidson Institute list of gifted summer programs, sorted by topics of interest:  https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/gifted-summer-programs-listed-by-topics-of-interest/\n\n#A Final Test\n\nOne final way to evaluate whether a program is high quality and \"worth it\" or not is to swap out the brand affiliation.  Pretend the program is being offered by a less prestigious college, e.g. a directional state school, rather than a T20.  If Middle Tennessee State offered you a pre-college summer program for $15K, would that look as alluring as the exact same program offered by an Ivy?  Highly selective admissions offices **will not** consider where a program was held or what affiliations/brands it has.  They're evaluating these on the basis of what the actual experience is like and what they can learn about YOU, the applicant, from your experience.  Two great examples of this - among the very best and most impactful summer programs you can do are the Anson Clark Scholars Program and the Simons Summer Research Program, which are held at Texas Tech and Stony Brook.  Those are great colleges, but not especially prestigious.  But it wouldn't matter whether those programs were held at Harvard or your local community college because they fully meet all the criteria I listed above.  By the same token, a go-through-the-motions paygram at a T20 won't hold much weight no matter where it's held or who is sponsoring it because it fails all or nearly all of the criteria.\n\n#TL;DR\n\nMost pre-college summer programs aren't very valuable for college admissions, despite their prestigious locations or high price tags.  Check out my criteria and list of quality programs to make the most of your time and money. \n\nIf you think I missed something, got something wrong, or just have questions, feel free to let me know in the comments or reach out on my website at www.bettercollegeapps.com.  Stay tuned for my next post on how to craft a strong application for truly selective summer programs."

It looks like another form of a SMP, but they offer you free tuition to the masters program for the 1st year then admission to the MD program after the 1st year if I am understanding that correctly. I am unsure if they finish the SMP during med school or before admission but the conditions are a 3.5 GPA (SMP GPA) and a 500 MCAT which seems SUPER reachable for many folks.\n\n  \nThe two cons I see is you need to have been a part of a previous Tufts program for eligibility or connections to UMass Boston or Spelman College. Also, they only provide tuition, not other living expenses.\n\n  \nWhat do yall think about this?"

    "body": "As an MD for 31 years and as many are gearing up for application season, I want to add some of my perspective. Getting into Medical School maybe a short term goal, but is clearly not the end. After Medical School you have to compete for Residency, after residency, you have to compete for jobs. The competition never really ends, if you want to call it a competition. If the position is highly desirable--you're going to compete. There is a bias against undergraduate schools if the school is unknown to the medical school, bias against DOs, bias against the quality of medical school. The key factor in making good doctors is CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. Many of the lower tiered medical schools and DOs may not have great clinical collaboration with hospitals and medical centers. Lack of clinical opportunities make for less experience within a time frame and less prepared you are as a resident and a new attending. Select a school and opportunity that offers alot of clinical experience. Generally speaking those are schools with better reputations. Although true these align with research institutions but it's fallacy to believe that this medical school is a research institution and not good clinically. My recommendation, try to get into the best program you can and always work very hard in whatever is ahead of you--because it allows for more options."

I cant believe that as an undergrad these people are so easily able to decide the sub-sub field of the science that they wanna pursue, and also become experts in said field to contribute to literature ???? Is it safe to assume that people who claim \"x papers published\" weren't just doing data or writing lab keeping tasks and were instead contributing much more ? \n\nUndergraduate research doesn't happen in my country, and without having any experience I cant really apply to US fellowships with any chance of acceptance. Even lower are the chances that I get funding, and I probably cant afford to live there for the duration of a project. Not only that, I don't even think I could contribute beyond what I already mentioned. It would take YEARS for me to understand my field inside out, understand all the important existing literature and the current situation of the field, all while being uncertain if it is what I wanna study because I literally just started college a year ago. I can't even do a proper literature review without referring to 20 books because obviously I don't know what these people who spent 20 years studying this topic are talking about, when I started 6 months ago.\n\nThis is making me feel so hopeless, I cant get accepted to a good research based masters program without already having some under my belt. My only hope seems to by applying to programs in Europe, where undergrad research still isn't as normalized.\n\nCould the Americans please clear this up ? Are you just smarter and better than everyone else ? Or is something of questionable academic integrity going on in the publishing houses of the USA."

Some smaller colleges are in consortiums or partnerships where cross-university courses and research are possible. For example, check out the Quaker Consortium with UPenn, Haverford, Swarthmore, and Bryn Mawr.\n\n\n\n**A side note:** medical school admission officers will tell you that they value a wide range of majors in their applicants. Gone are the days of just biology and chemistry majors applying to medical school. If you have other interests, consider a different major while still joining the pre-medical program and completing the pre-requisite courses. Pre-med students can be found in majors like global health, child development, neuroscience, cognitive studies, Asian studies, and sociology.\n\nIf grad school (or med school) is the plan, broaden your options.

    "body": "Hello r/gradadmissions,\n\nI'm a first-generation international applicant who recently completed a long graduate school application season and I’d like to share my experience. I applied to Master’s programs in Computer Science and some closely related fields. These kinds of posts helped me a lot when I was applying, so I hope this can offer a bit of insight (or at least some encouragement) to someone out there.\n\n*Note: This post roughly follows the structure commonly used in* r/collegeresults. *If you’re mainly interested in the outcomes - or if you come from a similar background - feel free to skip ahead to sections 5 (Admission Results) and 6 (Reflection)*.\n\n# 1. Background Information\n\n**Gender:** Male  \n**Nationality:** German  \n**Residence:** Small town in Baden-Württemberg \n**Personal Background:** No elite academic environment, no family ties to university, but a strong record of extracurriculars and academic development over time.\n\n**Education Path:** Hauptschule - Realschule - Gymnasium - Bachelor’s degree\n\n→ For those unfamiliar with the German school system: this path is quite unusual. I started in the lowest secondary education track (*Hauptschule*). Both *Hauptschule* and *Realschule* don’t qualify students for university. *Hauptschule*, in particular, carries a strong social stigma and is often associated with low academic expectations. Eventually, advancing to *Gymnasium* and earning the *Abitur* made me eligible for university.\n\n# 2. Academic Record\n\n**Undergraduate Institution:** Non-target university in Germany, but strong STEM curriculum  \n**Major:** Information Systems  \n**Minor:** Computer Science  \n**GPA:** 1.1 / 1.0 (German scale, with 1.0 being best); 3.93 / 4.00 (evaluated by an American evaluation service)  \n**Academic Honors:** Scholarship from one of Germany’s most respected foundations.\n\n**Research Experience:**\n\n* 4 months of nationally funded industry research, contributing to a published paper\n* 10 months of ML research (specifically XAI) at my university’s Chair of Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning\n\n**Professional Experience:**\n\n* 6 months internship (Data Science)\n* 6 months internship (Business Analytics)\n\n**GRE / GMAT:** Not required by the programs I applied to, so I didn’t take either.\n\n# 3. Extracurriculars & Community Service\n\nThere’s a lot, and it would take a whole new post, so I’ll just touch on that briefly.\n\nDuring my early school days, I started volunteering in my local church and joined our local sports club’s swimming division. Later, during *Gymnasium* (what one could roughly refer to as high school), I became a semi-professional athlete, eventually coaching young athletes and serving on the board of our local sports club.\n\nAt university, I joined the board of a national student association focused on education and helped shape the German education landscape for students across the country. I also started working as a volunteer programming tutor in my second year.\n\nMidway through my undergraduate studies, I began mentoring underrepresented groups in academia. Given my own background, this has always meant a lot to me personally.\n\n# 4. Statement of Purpose & Personal Statement\n\nThis one’s highly individual, and you should follow the outline you’re most comfortable with. Typically, the application portal will give you some guidance on what to cover in your statement.\n\nIn my case, I followed a structured outline. Depending on the school, I adjusted the focus. While each program required a slightly different perspective, I made sure that my core values and long-term goals came through consistently.\n\nFrom my point of view, there’s no blueprint that guarantees success. However, I’ve found it helpful to focus on a few key elements: personal motivation, academic foundation, relevant experience, and program-specific fit. Frankly, I think the latter is the most critical aspect to work on.\n\n# 5. Admission Results\n\n**Accepted:**\n\n* Brown (final decision)\n* Boston University\n\n**Waitlisted:**\n\n* Cornell Tech\n\n**Rejected:**\n\n* MIT\n* Harvard\n* Columbia\n* NYU\n\n# 6. Reflection\n\nLooking back, I realize that my goal was very ambitious. None of the schools I applied to would be considered a “safety” (at least as far as I’m aware). What mattered to me was how the programs \"felt\" (admittedly hard to put into words) based on the resources available, the way they communicated their values, and the atmosphere during virtual info sessions. With that in mind, these seven universities made it onto my short list.\n\nWhat’s worth mentioning is that this goal (to study at one of these universities) helped pull me out of a depression I had been suffering from for several years. I won’t go into detail here, but one day (still grateful for that moment) I realized that life holds far more possibilities than meets the eye. An article in a local magazine about American universities really piqued my interest. From that point on, I gave everything I had to build a strong academic profile. That was the very beginning of my undergraduate studies.\n\nHonestly, I don’t see myself as particularly brilliant compared to the many talented students around the world. I just worked hard, stayed as consistent as I could, and kept going. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was driven by this goal. Those three and a half years were, in a way, also the duration of my application journey.\n\nFrankly, I’m more than happy to join Brown’s Sc.M. in Computer Science since it was one of my three dream programs from the get go. Back in the day, when I started at *Hauptschule*, I didn’t even consider the idea of attending any university. It felt completely out of reach (at least, that’s what the social stigma suggested). Given my unconventional educational background and various extracurricular activities, the experiences I had have given me a unique perspective on life and learning.\n\nIn essence, I strongly believe that your path isn’t predetermined. It’s something you can shape through action. Search for opportunities to grow, be curious about different aspects of life, surround yourself with like-minded people, enjoy the ride (even when times aren’t that bright), and be grateful. If someone like me managed to achieve a goal like this, I bet you’ll do great once you get started!\n\nThat being said, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate you all! Best of luck with whatever comes next :)"

    "body": "Please help me decide between MIT and Stanford! Any opinion, any insight, and any anecdotal evidence would be MUCH appreciated. \n\nPlease let me know if this sort of post isn't allowed here, this is my first time on Reddit.\n\nCost is not a problem for either of these schools.\n\nI'm a girl planning to study either math, CS, or something related to these fields. My ideal plan is to go into pure math and eventually get a PhD but I am very likely to change my mind (my parents want me to go into CS for this reason, more versatile for finding a job in case I don't want to pursue academia). I am also interested in minoring in English or creative writing. \n\n**MIT Pros**:\n\n\\- Closer to home (I live on the East Coast)\n\n\\- AMAZING culture and history. MIT has been my dream school for all of high school and I have so many articles and blog posts saved of the amazing traditions at MIT... hacks, prank wars with Caltech, the weird obsession people have with poker (?) It seems like a place where I could really be happily nerdy.\n\n\\- Amazing math department and classes. Some classes I'm really interested in taking at the intersection of Math and CS, like Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning (18.337) and Computability and Complexity Theory (6.1400).\n\n\\- So many STEM outreach initiatives! I'm very passionate about teaching math and science and MIT has so many opportunities to volunteer and get involved with that. \n\n\\- Cross-registration at Harvard and Wellesley (would allow me to take interesting humanities and writing classes).\n\n**MIT Cons:**\n\n\\- Super academically rigorous. As someone who went to a pretty average HS and had to work really hard in high school, I definitely am not prepared for the rigor of MIT and would have to study a lot over the summer.\n\n\\- Math research opportunities for undergrads seem kind of limited? I would most likely get involved in doing applied math/CS research (which is totally fine, but MIT's math department doesn't seem to be super undergrad-focused - please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\n\\- There seems to be a big quant culture at MIT. I am not interested in working in finance whatsoever and am afraid I will \"sell out\" (this is probably an irrational fear of mine, lol.)\n\n**Stanford Pros**\n\n\\- Amazing location and weather\n\n\\- Math research seems to be more accessible. There's the Stanford Undergraduate Institute in Mathematics with funding provided and a directed reading program where you get paired up with a grad student mentor. I could also go on a CS Theory/Discrete Math subplan.\n\n\\- CS department is apparently super nice and accessible. When I spoke to Stanford students a lot of them said their reason for switching to CS was because the classes didn't feel intimidating at all whereas other Stanford departments did.\n\n\\- Amazing English department with lots of writing classes I could take\n\n\\- Also a ton of STEM outreach initiatives to get involved in, though I know less about them.\n\n**Stanford Cons**\n\n\\- Quite far from home\n\n\\- Definitely a much more pre-professional environment compared to MIT. As of right now I am not remotely interested in joining a startup/entrepreneurship/things that feel like a hallmark of Stanford culture, so I'm afraid that I won't fit in as much as I would at MIT.\n\n\\- \"Duck syndrome\" and burning out. I know this is Stanford's take on a much larger problem but I've suffered from mental health issues in the past and want to avoid that in college. I certainly could be being paranoid but I feel like I am very susceptible to whatever environment I find myself in.\n\nOverall, I think I would honestly be happy at either school, which is why I'm having such a hard time deciding. I have people tugging me in both directions and I change my mind every minute. I truly don't know how I'm going to make a decision by Thursday and it might just come down to a coinflip at this point. Any advice for choosing a college or more information would be helpful. Thank you so much!"

However, I’d applied to PhD programs in political science this year and didn’t get into a single one. Based on all other guidance I was planning on emailing potential advisors, and when chatting with a professor before class one day told him that that was my next step (this was back in September). However, this professor effectively told me not to because “professors at big universities get so many emails” and “you don’t want to overburden their inbox”. To add some important context: my undergrad is a very small liberal arts college. There’s no PhD offered here and our masters options are very limited. Undergraduate degrees are open curriculum. The professor I was talking to is a professor of history. I’m worried that given his time away from larger institutions (he’s tenured at my undergrad) he gave me some bad advice. I’m honestly unsure at this moment if I’ll be seeking a PhD after my masters due to all the uncertainty right now, but if I do I’m hoping to get some further insight from all of you. "

I applied to the clinical science and neuroscience programs at one university, as well as the masters in my current neuro department, with clinical science being my first choice. \n\nAfter being rejected from my current department due to significant funding/budget cuts from the school, I felt so defeated because I knew it was because my grades were lower than many of the other applicants. I wondered how I could possibly get accepted to another school if I couldn't even get in with my current undergraduate supervisor (that I would've continued working with) heavily vouching for me. I felt a bit better about my rejection after learning that the incoming cohort is tiny compared to previous years, but still worried about my other applications. \n\nToday, I got my acceptance letter for the masters in neuroscience program at the other university and I'm so incredibly happy! I still have yet to hear from the clinical science program, but this is the biggest weight lifted off my shoulders. I feel like I could cry.  \n\nThis past year has been incredibly challenging. I've put in so much effort to retake classes to boost my grades, learn as many lab techniques as I can, and get my name on publications to help my application. At the end of the day, I think my experience and love for my work shone through and evened out my decent but not amazing grades. I'm just so so glad my hard work paid off.

I applied in the 23-24 cycle, got waitlisted at three programs, and was accepted into one in biomedical sciences that I wasn't excited about. I matriculated into the program and matched to a lab, and now, entering my second year, I want out. It's the wrong program for me, as I feared. I am training myself, and mentoring three undergrads, all before quals. My PI expects that I'll have my first 1st author paper ready for publication shortly, and I should be excited, but instead, I'm resentful of the lack of mentorship in my program. I plan on mastering out after qualifying exams, with an additional paper or two on my CV, when I had none in my first round. Has anyone else gone through something similar? Is this a justifiable reason to jump ship? I know this is an admissions forum, but I'm hoping some people have advice about my situation. I chose to pursue a PhD because I wanted training to become an independent scientist, but I'm not getting the training I need. Instead, I was thrown into the ocean and told to swim, with some undergraduates drowning alongside me. Don't get me wrong- I enjoy working with them, but I can't train them effectively and nurture their love of science without learning the ropes myself."

    "body": "I applied to 5 schools this cycle for PhD programs (physical sciences) - at two of those schools in particular, I had some really good connections with professors who I met either in person or on Zoom - one professor at one school told me I had a really good shot of getting in, and another professor at a different school told me that if i were to get accepted I would have a spot on her team - she'd even put in a good word for me with the admissions committee.\n\nI also have quite a bit of research under my belt (one full year in one subfield and another year in a different subfield from undergrad, and i've also been doing a post-bacc since I graduated last May that will end in June). I had a nearly 4.0 major-specific GPA with a 3.7 overall, and i have two bachelors degrees, with the one i was trying to pursue graduate studies having an honors distinction. I also had quite a bit of extracurricular leadership experience from other organizations in my undergrad career.\n\nSo, I thought, with all of that, \"Oh, well, I'm sure to get in *SOMEWHERE*!\"\n\nSpoiler: I did not (lol). I received my last rejection yesterday, after having been put on a waitlist originally about a month prior. One school I still haven't heard from, but I don't expect to, nor was I planning on going if I were accepted.\n\nSo...yeah. I'm absolutely disappointed, at least a little. And I'm certainly a little angry at the fact that most (if not all) of those rejections were probably due to the funding issues going on.\n\n**However.**\n\nI'm approaching this whole situation with a particular point of view (and I do risk sounding a little bit not self-aware, here, but I will take that risk): **\"There is very little chance that any of this outcome is my fault.\"** I know I did my best, that I'm a strong applicant, and most importantly: *I know that the outcome of what happened was purely out of my control.* I think the situation of me being a senior in high school in 2020 - and therefore having to pivot my plans for where to go for undergrad - has changed my perspective when things like this happen. Life is always going to be stupid, and throw curveballs. What matters more is what I choose to do about it.\n\nI'm sharing all of this because I've been watching this subreddit, seeing people like me get rejected from schools, having their offers rescinded, and even more people being in danger of having to move back to their home countries given their student visas expiring when they graduate. I've even seen some CURRENT undergraduate students having their student visas revoked.\n\n**It's a scary, difficult time to be getting an education in the US, honestly.** And I know that all of us, myself included, are feeling a wide range of emotions about what is going on - whether you've been accepted into a program or not, or whether you're an international student or not.\n\nI want you to know: ***you are not alone.*** We see you.\n\nI'm choosing to celebrate those of us who got in - which, seriously, congratulations to you all, you have ultimate bragging rights, I think, haha - and comfort those of us who didn't. Because the most important thing right now is to keep a sense of community, especially when times like this happen.\n\nOverall, though, I'm sending love to everyone here, and everyone being affected by the bullcrap of the US. **We will get through this.** <3"

Thank you so much!\n\n\n\nHow I’ve addressed it and how it's going\n\nI have discussed my cycle results with colleagues, mentors, family, and friends and we think my struggles are caused by poor interviewing skills and/or cuts to federal funding for biomedical research. \n\nSince I can control my interviewing, I am trying to improve that. I have practiced SDN questions a lot more this cycle for 2 interviews I have completed in September (very grateful). I found a helpful reddit post for preparing for interviews, and I already do most of what it says but not everything. For possible future interviews, I will take the remaining advice from that post and continue prepping a lot. This includes practicing my answers to common interview questions and looking directly at the camera (I was not totally doing that at first). A lot of people in my life did say I speak well and seem knowledgeable and passionate about science and medicine when speaking with me and in a mock interview. This is what I am currently working on.\n\nI decided to ask for advice here because I was rejected from one of my interviews this cycle. It was MMI style and at one of my state schools the University of Missouri Kansas City. I practiced a lot for the MMIs by finding advice for how to answer them and common questions online, outlining my responses, and practicing speaking them out loud to people and the camera. I feel like it went ok - I answered questions exactly how I practiced and every interviewer laughed or smiled a bit (I tend to be kindof a funny guy with an expressive, dynamic, effervescent personality which could also be negatively impacting me). My stats are a lot higher than their range, but I would have loved to attend the school. We mostly think it’s yield protection, lack of fit being research heavy, or I didn’t answer the questions as well as I thought I did.

Then the conversation went about my whole background, as a first-generation student and a child of immigrants and he started asking more about my family, and what my parents did. He also asked my stats what other schools I'm applying to and what schools the previous years students got into(I said UCSD and UCI and some UCLA and UC Berkeley). He also asked about my AP Classes and how my school worked and seemed surprised that my school didn't offer AP Bio/Chem. He asked about some words my teachers would describe me with and then he asked me why I thought so. He never specifically asked me why Stanford (I prepared a lot for this question so I turned them into questions about specific programs). He wanted to know more about my community outreach and how I impacted the community, (extracurriculars basically). In the end, he told me I would be a good addition to any school I end up in and to email him where I ended up going and for any follow-up questions. So overall I think it went okay and it felt more like a conversation.\n\n  \np.s I think I got an interview because I'm from the bay area and live close to Stanford."

    "body": "This cycle I was accepted to a PhD program at NYU with an admissions rate of about 2%, which feels like a big deal considering I have a bad and complicated undergrad GPA. I’ll share the sketch of my story in case it helps anyone else. \n\nTLDR version; had a low undergrad GPA but made up for it with a stellar career, life experiences such as learning multiple languages and living in multiple countries and regions, by the luck of meeting a famous academic who I gelled with, and through having the guts to ask the academic to collaborate with me. \n\nIn undergrad I transferred from a school with few requirements to one with lots. That means I ended up doing most of my beginning coursework in required subjects at the END of my undergraduate career. My GPA for the first two years before I transferred was 3.7. My GPA for my last two years of college was 2.5. CGPA was 3.2, but the real kicker is that my later school didn’t count my first two years of coursework into my overall GPA meaning the transcript where I earned my diploma only shows 2.5. Pretty rough. \n\nHowever, after school, I did a one year graduate certificate course in a subject I really cared about at a respected school and earned a 4.0. \n\nThat led me to a career I really cared about and found a few subject areas within the career that I fell in love with and began to specialize in. Somewhere along the way, and this is the really lucky part, I realized my love for my subject area was shared with a wonderful academic. We began to collaborate, and I realized only later that they are pretty famous. The collaboration only happened because I straight up asked if they wanted to collab, which was nerve wracking but by that point in my life I had already learned that you’ll never get what you don’t ask for!\n\nAll throughout these years of career, my shame about my low GPA was holding me back from applying to PhD programs, despite doing well in my field and being passionate about the work. My collaborator really encouraged me to apply and wrote a key LOR. Without them, I truly could not have done it. \n\nAlso besides my primary career during the time between undergrad and starting my PhD, I learned three additional languages (having already spoken two prior), and lived in three countries and multiple states. I think what helped as well in my application was finding a way to frame the PhD as being an inevitable result of and link between all these experiences. \n\nI’ll be 35 when I start school in the fall, and honestly, I’m glad I waited. I’ve done so much along the way, and I think it all helped make me a much stronger candidate. And I’m grateful I’ll get to have more time and space to fill in gaps in my knowledge and write the book!\n"

    "body": "I am a professor on the admissions committee at a medium sized T20 engineering department in the US and wanted to share some honest perspectives from the other side, as we often aren't allowed to explicitly answer certain types of applicant questions. For example, many applicants want to know our acceptance rate which are not supposed to share. My program accepts roughly 35-40 students out of 600+ applications, and our yield tends to be somewhere between 50-60% of those admits join the program.\n\n**Our process:** the admissions committee reviews applicants and ranks them on a score from 1 to 3, where 1 is excellent, 2 is good, and 3 is unsuitable. Most applicants are fairly realistic about their chances of getting in, I would estimate roughly 10% get rank 1, 85% rank 2, and only 5% of odd cases are ranked 3. After that, the scores and application materials are shared with the rest of the department. We are a direct-match program (i.e., students get accepted directly to individual lab groups, rather than as a cohort), so individual PIs then get to decide who they will interview. The admissions committee will make notes of which professors should look closely at which applicants. Not every professor will have funding for new PhD students every year, so many applications (even excellent ones) are never strongly considered. Rank 2 applicants are sometimes accepted if the research fit with the professor is very good.\n\nYou may have heard this before, but there is **no such thing as a safety school** for graduate applications. We routinely reject rank 1 applicants simply because there isn't a professor in their field of interest who has an open position that year. So having the best profile does not mean you will get accepted, you also need to get lucky that the right position in the right group is funded for you that year. For smaller, less research active schools, this means that there are often fewer positions available, so some of those programs may actually be harder to get into compared to larger and higher ranked programs like MIT, Michigan, and Georgia Tech which need to hire large numbers of students to support their massive research programs.\n\n**GPA matters.** While research proficiency is most important for a PhD, a poor undergraduate GPA doesn't bode well for your chances of successfully completing the pre-requisite coursework in a graduate program. These classes are hard, and if you are spending all of your time studying just to do okay, you won't have time to start research and your chances of passing the qualifying exam will be lower. Many professors consider \\~3.7 or above to be acceptable, but top applicants usually have 3.8 or above. I don't say this to discourage you if your GPA is lower, but I also don't want to sugar coat what type of profile tends to be accepted.\n\nA question I see all of the time is: **does research experience offset a mediocre GPA?** The diplomatic answer you'll get from most admissions staff is that applications are reviewed holistically and there is no minimum GPA. But the honest answer is: probably not. Several applicants will have both research experience and an excellent GPA, and in many cases the \"superstar\" rank 1 candidates will have a higher GPA **in addition** to more research experience than a rank 2 applicant with a decent GPA and some research experience.  Out of the 100s of applications I have read, I can only think of one case where a candidate had a 3.2 GPA but such excellent research experience and letters of recommendation that the application was still strongly considered.\n\nAnother common misconception is the importance of publishing as an undergraduate or masters student. Having a publication can certainly boost your application, but it is far from a prerequisite. We routinely accept students who have no publications. Doing science takes time, and doing good science is usually especially slow. In fact, having your name on subpar publications might actually work against you. I was recently contacted by an international masters student who has more publications than me, because their father is a professor who has been adding their name to all of his (not very good) publications for the last 6 years. I am fairly confident that this super-obvious \"gaming\" of the academic system will result in this student getting rejected from all top programs. Then they will go to grad cafe or reddit and complain about how impossible it is to get accepted into graduate school if they got rejected despite having X number of papers. So don't get discouraged if you haven't published when you read those types of posts!\n\nAnother common question seems to be whether international students are at a disadvantage. The sad answer is yes. This is for a few reasons: (1) there are many funding mechanisms only open to US students (the big one being NSF GRFP, but there are several others), making it easier for professors without enough funding to accept them, (2) we know exactly what a 3.9/4.0 from the University of Delaware means, it might be harder to evaluate a 9.0/10 from IISc, (3) we are more likely to have a connection to, or know of, the professors at American universities writing letters for those students. The deck is especially stacked against Iranian applicants. Although there are many wonderful junior scientists in Iran we would love to bring over, the reality of visa delays/rejections and extra scrutiny means many programs/professors can't or won't gamble on making offers to those students. If you are international, don't give up hope though! There aren't enough excellent American students to fill all the US programs, so most top schools still end up with a majority of international students. You just might need to apply more broadly than an American student would.\n\nMake sure to get your applications in on time, including letters of recommendation and IETLS/TOEFL scores. While exceptions might be made for superstar candidates, last year we weren't even forwarded the applications that weren't completed at the deadline. I had a few students reach out to me to ask if I'd seen their application, and I hadn't because their IETLS scores were delayed and the admissions staff had only sent us complete applications.\n\nMy final thought is to make sure your personal statement reads well, especially the first few paragraphs. This is the first part of the application we look at and we generally make a judgement fairly early in reading. I try to do the courtesy of reading each statement in its entirety because I feel that we owe that to applicants who put so much time into applying, but the reality is that many professors will skim the statements and make a snap judgement since we are analyzing so many.  If you aren't a strong writer, **use AI** to help! AI writing tools can help level the playing field for non-native English speakers. **However, do not** copy and paste directly from chatgpt. It is incredibly obvious when someone has done so. Make sure the statement still has your distinct voice and thoughts and does not include generic wording that doesn't tell us anything about you. Sentences such as \"I love XX field because I have always liked math and physics\" are true of every engineering applicant. I want to know more about you as a person, and every word you choose to include in this statement should help make your case. I realize that this is easy advice to give, and not easy advice to incorporate, but do your best to think about what makes you unique and interesting. Also, don't be afraid to brag a about your accomplishments. If you have published, won awards, conducted outreach, etc., include that in your statement. Give us context for awards we may not have heard of (selected out of XX applicants), include metrics of impact (my outreach project was shared with XX number of low income students). Give us context to your research experiences (how long were you with a group, did you work alone or under a postdoc/phd student, what tools did you use, what were your main contributions to any resulting publications, etc.). And of course, have someone proofread. Sentences that make sense to you might sound like gibberish to someone else, which is why we often cannot effectively evaluate our own writing.\n\nI hope this helps, best of luck with your applications everyone!\n\n  \n**Edit:** I am going to stop replying and close reddit on my computer soon, as I need to do some real work, but wanted to share a few final thoughts based on responses.\n\nA number of comments are asking for \"chance me\" based on their profile, which is really difficult to do. If you take away anything from this post, it should be that graduate admissions can be very subjective and even random, especially when decisions are left to each individual professor. You can absolutely be accepted to a top program with a 3.2, and you can also be rejected with a 4.0. The last thing I want to do is discourage anyone from pursuing their dream program, but I also want to be honest about what types of candidates are typically accepted to top programs. For example, my last few years of admits:\n\n* 3.5 UG, 3.9 M.S. International, 2 research experiences, 1 publication, 1 presentation, leadership experience, letter of recommendation from a professor I know and trust. SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific research field and as well as the application I care about\n* 3.85 UG, 3.95 MS. International, 2 research experiences, 2 presentations and 1 in-progress publications (but not published), leadership and volunteer experience. Referred by trusted colleague, excellent research fit.  \n* 16.5/20 UG, 3.7 MS. International, 3 research experiences, 2 publications, significant outreach experience, amazing letters of recommendation from unknown professors. SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific research and application I care about\n* 3.98 UG GPA. American, URM, 2 research experiences, no publications, significant outreach experience. Letter from a trusted colleague.  SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific field and and application\n* 3.8 UG GPA, dual major. American, URM, 2 research experiences, presentation but no publications, excellent leadership experience, referred by a trusted colleague. SOP a bit vague but good enough alignment with my research \n* 3.9 UG GPA, american. Top UG program. Awards, 1 research experience, one publication, 2 presentations, volunteer, leadership, outreach experience, excellent letters from unknown professors. SOP reflected good alignment with my research, but not with my application.  \n\nYou might notice a common theme is that referrals/letters from other professors I know personally hold a lot of weight. I have used the phrase \"take a gamble\" a lot in my comments, because that is what we are doing when we accept students. In between tuition, stipend, fringe, overhead, and research/travel costs, it costs over $100,000/year to train a PhD student at my institution. This is money we professors need to painstakingly fundraise. Because PhD positions are some weird combination of a job and a training program, making a bad hire can have an enormous impact on our research programs. It's not like a normal job where I can just fire someone if they aren't working out 2 months in. The last thing any professor wants to do is spend 200-300k training someone who ultimately isn't productive and burns out early because they actually don't care about the research area. This is why programs are so weird about \"**why us?**\" We want you to convince us that you will be happy and successful in this program and aren't going to drop out.  You might be the strongest applicant in the pile in terms of raw metrics, but if we don't see the clear alignment of interests you may not be accepted. \n\nPersonally, I am also very interested in personality match. I don't want to spend 5 years butting heads with someone because we have different priorities and working styles, and I especially don't want someone who will make the rest of my group miserable by being a pain to work with. This is why I put a lot of weight into personal recommendations from people I know. By the time I am interviewing candidates, it's really more of a \"vibe check\" than trying to assess competency. All professors are different though, some will really grill candidates for technical competency, which I personally find unproductive. \n\nFinally, if your profile is not as strong as the ones I have mentioned, please **do not despair** or give up hope on doing a PhD. I am describing the admissions process at a very competitive top program located in a highly desirable city. There are many R1s with high research activities and plenty of funding that don't make it onto top 20 lists. For example, state schools in \"rural\" states have access to a separate pot of NSF funding that coastal states do not have. The university of texas system has their own sizeable endowment. There are many excellent, T100 programs physically adjacent to top schools that are sometimes overlooked by applicants (i.e., NJIT near Princeton). Top schools located in less desirable locations will also be less selective. Because of the political climate there, colleagues from red / southern states have been complaining recently about not getting enough female and out-of-state applicants in their pools. Canadian programs have a very different funding mechanism than the US which results in more equitable distribution of funding across their various schools. Finally, try to find out if a program of interest has hired a lot of new professors recently, which suggests that the school has funding and potentially more openings for PhD students. \n\nIf you do decide to apply to top programs, make sure the alignment is clear in your SOP, and try not to take it as a personal failing if you end up not being selected. We all want to believe in a meritocracy with a fair and systematic process, but the reality is that professors making these decisions are just people and the system we use is sometimes arbitrary or downright stupid. We make mistakes, we overlook good candidates for stupid reasons or because of personal biases, we spend less time on applicants describing research interests far from our own fields, we forget to read the last 2 applications on the pile of 100s, etc. I know candidates often want to know \"what was wrong with my application that I didn't get selected?\" but this is the wrong way to think about it because there may have been nothing wrong with your application. In reality, it was just that something in someone else's profile that made them stand out to that particularly professor, such as a letter of recommendation from the right person. "

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a second-year med student at the University of North Carolina who got accepted to med school after three cycles and MANY rejections. I’m not really one to post on Reddit, but I really don’t like med school admissions. I don’t think the best applicants get in each year, and I think the process has a lot of flaws. So if anything I learned during my three years in the trenches can help someone who is where I was two years ago, then I want to share it.\n\nI have a pretty big sample size of schools, and by the end of it, I had done most of the typical premed experiences. I don’t really consider myself a special applicant with any sort of X factor, so I feel like my advice might be more generalizable than people who had super high MCAT scores, some crazy backstory, or other wild variable that helped them get in. I’m really just a dude who wants to be a doctor because I like science and want to help people (don’t put that on a personal statement).\n\n**Background on how my cycles went**\n\nStats (same all three cycles): GPA 3.7 with a 4.0 post-bac, 514 MCAT School background: Majored in Econ and decided to go to med school 2 months before I graduated college in 2019. That’s really where my application began—before that, I had essentially just focused on making the best grades I could, aside from a few short summer jobs. No prestigious internships or anything crazy.\n\nI minored in astronomy, so I had already taken a few science classes, but most of my prereqs came from my post-bac program. I did undergrad at UNC and my post-bac at American University in DC.\n\nFirst cycle:\n\nFirst time I applied, I felt pretty good about my application. I had pretty decent stats, 10 months working as a scribe, had just started working as a CNA, and had some volunteering experience. I had some great mentors giving me advice and definitely did my research before applying. I thought I had good writing, applied early in the cycle, and stuck to schools that don’t favor in-state applicants too much.\n\nUltimately, I got 3 interviews and no acceptances. I applied to about 30 schools. I was bummed but not too discouraged because I knew a lot of people don’t get in on their first try.\n\nSecond cycle:\n\nFelt really good going into this cycle. I had worked as a CNA for a year, which I loved and wrote about super passionately. I really thought this would show through since I’d been told getting into med school was not about checking boxes—you need to do things you’re passionate about. I also had more volunteering experience this cycle.\n\nEnded up getting only 2 interviews and no acceptances, so I did worse, which made no sense to me. I applied to about 35 schools.\n\nThird cycle:\n\nI was stressing bad because I felt like I had been doing all the right things and working harder than I ever had before but still couldn’t get in anywhere. My MCAT was going to expire after this cycle, and I wasn’t sure I could go through that again. Also got the lowest quartile on Casper (can rant about Casper for a while, but we’ll hold off).\n\nSome days I would just wake up at 3:00 AM with heart palpitations or my mind racing, and I’d be like, “Well, I guess I just have to start my day.” It sucked. I held nothing back this cycle and applied to an absurd 68 schools.\n\nI added a research experience (no pubs or poster) and had around 100 hours volunteering at a free clinic. Amazingly, I got 18 interviews, so many I had to start turning them down, which I never thought would happen. Of the 9 I attended, I got 7 acceptances and 2 waitlists.\n\n**What made the difference between the second and third cycle?**\n\nFirst off, I applied to DO schools for the first time and had a lot of success, so just broadening my school selection helped. But I also had a huge jump in MD success, which I think speaks to the changes I made.\n\n*Check every box*\n\n- When I was doing my research for applying, I came away with the impression that med school admissions was supposed to be holistic and not about checking boxes. So instead of doing scientific research, I put most of my time into being a CNA, something I was passionate about and that aligned with my reasons for studying medicine.\n- But saying med school isn’t about checking boxes is really only half true. I only saw wide-spanning success when I maxed out all parts of the rubric. Me being a CNA—no matter how passionate I was—just wasn’t enough to overcome my lack of research and underserved volunteering.\n- When schools decide who to interview and accept, I can say with pretty high confidence they use some kind of rubric. Anytime you’re being graded by a rubric you better have all categories accounted for. I don’t have a copy of a rubric and don’t know exactly what each school uses, but you really want to cover all your bases.\n- Doing research didn’t change my motivation for medicine at all. I loved my lab, and the research they were doing was cool—but I essentially just pipetted for a year. That’s the game though.\n\n*Big experiences you need to hit:*\n\nStrong clinical experience (CNA and EMT are the strongest IMO. Medical assistant also works. I have mixed feeling about being a scribe, but plenty of people get into med school scribing. I was both a scribe and a CNA and found having a hands-on experience where you’re actually talking to patients way more impactful and way easier to write about. Is being a scribe even a thing right now with AI???)\n- Underserved volunteering (non-clinical is actually encouraged, but if you do clinical volunteering, try to do it at a free clinic)\n- Research\n- Shadowing (I think it’s dumb, but just do it—it might be part of a school’s rubric)\n\n*Don’t waste time on things you can’t write or speak passionately about*\n\nChecking the boxes is not enough—but it’s the first step. Next step is making sure the boxes you’re checking actually matter.\n\nOne of my volunteer experiences was Red Cross blood drives. I had 200+ hours volunteering where I just checked names off a list. Super hard to write about. Contrast that with volunteering as a medical assistant at a free clinic, where every shift brought a new story and I interacted with patients every day. That experience practically wrote itself—same with being a CNA.\n\nSome of my experiences were a complete waste of time, but I did them because they were easy. Don’t do that. Do stuff that’s hard and makes you grow—it will be worth it. You’ll be able to talk about it passionately and become a better person because of it.\n\n*Make your experiences into a narrative (you can do this retroactively)*\n\nFor some reason admissions committees are addicted to the idea of a narrative. If you’re like me and don’t have some crazy story or special reason for wanting to do medicine, this can seem hard. But you can actually craft this narrative retroactively.\n\nExample: When I got my research job, I applied to every research job in North Carolina I could find that I was remotely qualified for—over 120. Only one gave me an offer, it was a lab researching an HIV vaccine. Since I only got one offer, I didn’t really have any choice on which job to take. Me not having any other option is one story I could’ve told med schools, but that’s not a very good story. Instead, I framed it like this:\n\nAs a CNA and volunteer MA in my hometown, I saw how much my community struggles to accept vaccine science and often distrusts medicine. How do I know vaccines are safe? What goes into making them? I wanted to take an active role in vaccine research so I could better serve as a liaison between my hometown and the scientific community.\n\nWay better story than “this was the only job that got back to me.” Even though both are true.\n\nTry to connect all your experiences—even retroactively. Life is unpredictable and sometimes you have to do experiences just simply because they’re the only option, but you can be creative and craft a logical connection or narrative after the fact, and it looks way better than dumping a bunch of random experiences on your app.\n\n*Interviewing*\n\nInterview stage I had a high interview success rate my third cycle and was either waitlisted or accepted at every school I interviewed at. My biggest advice here is don’t focus on “being yourself.” Focus on knowing yourself. By this point in the process, I had written about myself so much, and put a lot of work into my secondaries in primary application over three years. I knew my story so well, and I had countless anecdotes to back it up.\n\nMy formula:\n\nState your opinion then back it up with an experience.\n\nEvery time you have an ethical dilemma, hard day at work, or meaningful patient interaction—write it down. One well-known story can answer 50% of interview questions just by tweaking which part of it you emphasize.\n\nIf you’re doing experiences that are meaningful and actually making you grow, you’ll have plenty to talk about.\n\nLean into your interests outside of medicine. Be specific. Most interviews are predictable, some are super random — but if you know yourself, you’ll adapt.\n\nSometimes they just want to know have you thought about things critically. One of my interviews spent the first 15 minutes talking about how speaking English allows you to travel almost anywhere and still find people who understand you, whereas other languages don’t. I did that interview from Japan at 3AM in a T-shirt and gym shorts because I had planned that trip for late March and then got an interview invite on the flight over there. That topic made up 1/4 of my interview and it was just a random thing I found interesting as I was traveling. I got into that school.\n\n**School selection**\n\nWhere you apply matters so much. On my third cycle, I had a massive spreadsheet with every med school in MSAR and their out-of-state interview percentages.\n\nBut also, even with all the growth I had on my third cycle, I still received 45 rejections! A lot of this process is luck and who reads your app—but you can still stack the odds in your favor.\n\n**Why should you listen to me?**\n\nI was down bad. I was rethinking my whole life. If I didn’t get in, I was maybe gonna try to go to a Caribbean school, but I don’t know. My whole path was up in the air. I really know what it’s like to not be able to get into med school. I easily received over 100 rejection emails and was probably rejected from 70 different schools in total. That’s an embarrassingly high number, but I did learn A LOT through all the rejections and had some great mentors along the way.\n\n**Closing**\n\nI have so much more advice I could give on med school admissions and so many things I could rant about but I won’t make this post 20 pages long.\n\nIf this helped anyone, I’d be happy to rant about other topics or even make a video going through the specifics of my application and why I think I was successful at certain schools. I have no shortage of rants. I lived and breathed this for three years. I truly wish I didn’t know as much about admissions as I do.\n\nIf you’re struggling to get in, I know how heartbreaking it is to work incredibly hard for something and fail.\n\nFor the longest time, I thought getting into med school defined me. I put all my self-worth into whether or not I could get accepted. Now that I’m in med school, I realize how dumb that was.\n\nIf you really want this, don’t quit. Give it your all. Failure is growth. But don’t ever attach your self-worth to this process. It has so many flaws, and admissions committees are full of contradictions.\n\nMost importantly medicine is not everything—not even close. Find fulfillment in your life right now. Don’t attach it to an arbitrary goal or you will never find happiness. I’m still trying to master that myself."

    "body": "I got a 1570 on the SAT this june.\n\nI had gotten a 1530 last summer and my dad was NOT happy with that score, so he made me sign up for SAT...after SAT...insisting that I must score 1550+. He made me drop EVERYTHING to study for the SAT. I have a lot of ECs and APs and dropping all this for a stupid test took a huge hit. Dad made me skip a week of school to grind for the SAT and took the April SAT. Got an abysmal score. Was grounded and sent to the backrooms to study yet again.\n\ntook the june SAT, felt okay about it, and got my result two weeks later when I was at an international competition that i'd been grinding for 6+ months and 2000+ miles away from home. After I had competed, I checked my score and practically fell to my knees with joy. called my parents about it and they literally could not care less. I won 1st place at that international competition (hell yeah) and went home.\n\nmy dad looked at me and said, \"well, it would be a shame if you'd done all that \\*fucking\\* work and not gotten anything.\" yeah. that's it. nothing about my sat score that he'd spent the last year agonizing me about, nothing about my project, just nothing.\n\nthat very SAME night, my dad physically dragged me out of bed while I was sleeping and screamed at me for 2 hours (until 1:30 a.m.). why? because I was shadowing a doctor next day and the shoes I was going to wear \"triggered him.\" My faded pink Nikes that were going to be covered by my suit were going to \"embarrass him.\" He then shoved a pair of skinny jeans (jeans are a huge NO in shadowing doctors) and my 10 y/o brother's blazer. Guess learning that you got a 1570 just 24 hours prior doesn't grant you immunity from his anger.\n\nMy mere existence has seemed to \"trigger\" my dad this past year. There is ALWAYS something wrong with what I'm doing. And his constant anger, the constant fights, screaming matches, are all just killing me.\n\nWhen I turned 17, I didn't have time to celebrate, as I had a shitton of exams around the corner and projects to do. My mom insisted on going for a family birthday dinner, so we went. at the resturaunt, my dad started yelling my brother because he refused to eat the food he ordered and promptly left the resturaunt and drove home, leaving everyone else at the restaurant. never apologized. on his birthday, he asked why i didn't have anything for him. i referenced this particular instance and he got really mad and said I was \"playing victim\" and was just an unforgettable brat that was \"ungrateful\" for everything he does.\n\nI am an artist, and a damn good one at that. It's my biggest spikes for college apps. The day junior year ended, I went home, happy that i'd finally get to paint for the first time in weeks, as I'd been busy with my 6 AP classes and whatnot. I thought I'd be able to do this in peace, since my grades were really fucking good (lowest grade was a 97 in AP Physics w/ no grade inflation) and my parents obviously knew how much I'd been studying (was up till 3 studying for like the entire semester), so i'd figure they wouldn't have any problem with it.\n\nI asked my mom if she could take me to the art store (guess who doesn't have a license) so I could buy a few paints that I ran out of. She tells my dad, and he LOST his shit. like, this resulted in the worst fight we've ever had. he went into my room and physically dragged out my easel and threatened to rip apart my paintings.\n\nBasically, he didn't want me to do art. At all. He said I should focus on my college apps. not my stupid and frivolous paintings.\n\nThis is where I got extremely fed up, especially since I was planning to submit an arts supplement to all of my top schools. I fought with him. I had spent the year grinding to the point where my own hair was falling out and the least I could do was spent two hours a day painting during the summer?? somehow, this devolved into him telling me I could go ahead and \"k!ll myself\" or he could just kick me out of the house or he should leave. Ever since then, he's been joking about kicking me out when I'm 18. H\n\nThese fights continued over the summer. I avoid him like the plague, and he takes the few instances he can catch me to tell me what I'm doing wrong in life. Now, right before I'm starting to apply for colleges, he told me he won't pay a single cent if I don't get into a T20 or an ivy league. Well, shit. Guess I'll start applying for scholarships. I got selected as finalists for a couple of smaller scholarships. instead of being happy, he just told me that my head was \"always in the clouds\" and I get too easily distracted??????\n\nMy research (that my dad insisted I drop, until it actually started winning a few competitions) poster got accepted into a medical undergrad/phd conference at my/his dream college. I was so fucking over the moon, and I guess he was too because he actually is letting me travel across the country to go present my work. Though, when I got my poster (that I finalized after weeks of hard work) printed out at my local makerspace, he literally didn't even want to take a look at it. my mom just glanced at it and was like, \"cool.\" i'm literally so done. nothing I do will ever make them happy.\n\nI've been staying up till 3 am daily grinding my homework, working on my patent, preparing for research conferences/competitions, writing a research paper, and still working on getting my college apps done. I barely leave my room. Yet, every morning, he will still scream at me because of something. I'm genuinely so tired of this. I go to school practically sobbing every day,\n\nLast night, my dad was talking to my uncle about how I'm so \"unfocused\" and literally all I do is \"focus on my art\" (haven't painted in 5 months) and how the only thing i have pertinent to my major is my research and I'll not get into a good college (his version of good is HYPSM). He literally said I wasn't \"unique\" because he could name \"so many asian girls who were good at art and wanted to go into medicine.\" My uncle (both of his daughters graduated valedictorian from their IB school and attended T20s) was appalled at my father's words and kept insisting I had done more than his own daughters had ever done in high school. My father argued back.\n\nI don't know what I can do to satisfy that man. the most confusing part of all of this is that I used to be his little daddy's girl. he used to post my art all the time on his facebook or brag about me to all of his friends. I don't know what I did to change that. Anyway, there's so much I could gripe about, but it's 2:07 am and this post is already getting too long.\n\nEdit: Wow. I've been reading all the comments and am completely overwhelmed with everyone's kind words and encouragement. Thank you all so much, truly. I will do my best to get back to everyone here.\n\nI just wanted to leave a note saying I do love my family. I really do. I am grateful for my parents' hard work. I just wish they'd be grateful for mine.\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone. I've been feeling alone recently, and your comments have alleviated some of that sense of isolation. I hope everyone has a wonderful day. "

I know how exciting/stressful/anxiety-inducing/hopeful/dreadful this time of year can be. Take a breath.\n\nThere are a lot of ways you might respond if you don't get accepted to your Early Decision school, and there's no right way to feel disappointment. But, there are some maladaptive ways to respond to that bad news, and one is to question your entire process, panic, throw out your essays, and start over.\n\nDon't do that.\n\nThe fact is that there are a lot of reasons someone might not get into a school, especially a highly-selective one. Most of these reasons are totally out of your control. When I worked at Vanderbilt, we denied 95% of applicants, the vast majority of whom were *qualified* to attend. That's just the reality of [receiving 50,000 applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vs2mgq/how_do_admissions_offices_actually_process_50k/) for 1650 seats in a first-year class. Many of the students I advocated for were still denied (spoiler alert, they turned out fine). \n\nWanting control is natural. You control your essays and narrative, so it can be a natural response to think \"I got denied/ I must have done something wrong/ I need to rework my strategy.\" In all likelihood, a deep rework of your essay strategy will not be a good use of your time, especially over the holidays.\n\nConsider the analogy of applying to a job. If you apply to one job and don't get it, you shouldn't throw out your resume, cover letter, and interview strategy. You should apply to more jobs. \n\nLet me save you some time. If you don't get in, feel your feelings and sleep on it. If anything, revisit your list of safety, target, and reach schools, rather than your writing strategy. Have a trusted adult or counselor review your essays if you haven't already, but don't scrap everything and start over.\n\nI'll try to answer some ED and strategy questions in the comments if you have them. Good luck out there. You will land. ✌🏼"

    "body": "Everyone frets over brand-name campuses, but the evidence says the test score you walk in with does more of the heavy lifting later on. Long-run tracking of top-scoring teens in the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth found that the higher a kid’s SAT, the more likely they were, decades later, to hold PhDs, patents and six-figure jobs, regardless of where they enrolled for college.  ￼\n\nEconomists Stacy Dale and Alan Krueger tried the ultimate apples-to-apples test: they compared students who got into the same mix of selective and less-selective schools and then chose differently. Once you equalize ability (their SATs, class rank, extracurriculars), the earnings gap from picking Duke over Ohio State vanishes for the typical student. In other words, a kid with a 1550 who picks OSU is likely to earn about the same as their equally scored friend at Duke. A newer, massive Texas study replicated this: any wage boost from attending a “more selective” campus fades to zero within a few years, while factors like instructional spending and STEM completion matter far more.  ￼\n\nCaveats: if you grow up low-income or Black/Hispanic, selective colleges do add a meaningful bump; networks and support services seem to pay off there. And if you’re chasing pedigreed pipelines (think hedge-fund analyst or Supreme Court clerk), elite campuses still open doors. But for the median middle-class kid aiming for a solid career, the score on the front end is simply a stronger statistical signal than the logo on the diploma.\n\nBottom line: build the skills that push your SAT/ACT into the right tail, pick a school you can afford that offers the major you want, and graduate. Prestige is nice icing; the cake is your underlying ability.\n\n**TL;DR:** There’s no need to stress too much about the admissions game. If you have the stats to get into a top-20 school but don’t get in due to bad luck, you’ll very likely do just as well later in life. Hope for the best, and know that the worst case isn’t so bad."

    "body": "**Just some comments I think would be helpful for me:**\n\n1. **Awards don't matter nearly as much as you think.** They’re very supplementary. They will not carry an application with red flags. Most people at Ivies don't have any major awards, if any at all. In fact, just because you have solid accomplishments (e.g., a grand award at ISEF, Olympiads) doesn't mean you're guaranteed admission. I know an AIME qualifier four years in a row who didn’t even get into our state flagship. Colleges care much more about your potential than what you’ve already done. Off the top of my head, I know five ISEF award winners, two STS semifinalists, and one person who was both an STS semifinalist and an ISEF grand award winner, none of whom got into a single T20 school.\n2. **Teacher recommendations and essays matter way more than you think.** A lot of Ivies and top schools use something called a \"personality score.\" (EDIT: not necessarily a personality score, but how well you would bond in their specific community as a person). I even know someone with a 1300 SAT and basically zero extracurriculars who got waitlisted at Harvard purely because of his teacher recs and essays. For more info, he didn’t even get into our state flagship either. State schools are much more stats based so it shows that academically, this person wasn't your traditional Harvard candidate, but still was put into the pool of potential candidates.\n3. **College applications aren't quantitative.** Just because someone gets into Harvard doesn’t mean they’ll get into Cornell. Similarly, just because someone with a profile similar to yours gets into Yale doesn’t mean you will too. And crucially, just because you don’t get into UMich doesn’t mean there’s no chance you'll get into an Ivy League school. I know 2 people at my school who got deferred from UMich but ended up at a HYPSM. I was also deferred from UMich, and I ended up getting into UPenn.\n4. **Don't let people get into your head as EA and RD results roll out.** When I didn’t get into UMich, someone who did get in had the audacity to come up to me and say, “Imagine doing all that work just to end up at your state flagship.” Like, I’m not the one paying $90K a year to attend an out-of-state public school (that was them)!! Honestly, I don’t think they meant it maliciously. They were probably just insecure because they had gotten rejected from CMU CS and a few other private schools that same day, and wanted to feel superior. Sometimes, it’s best to distance yourself from people during college application season, especially the day after Ivy Day.\n5. **Don't watch college reaction videos PLEASE.** They just make the process way more heartbreaking than it needs to be. Also, don’t record your reactions. It only adds to the emotional weight, and honestly, it gets depressing.\n6. **Your unweighted GPA matters a lot.** It shows whether you can handle the school's academic rigor, and it can sometimes (though not always) reflect the strength of your teacher recs. People with higher GPAs tend to have stronger recs because they’re often more hardworking and dedicated. Of course, that's not a hard rule, and there are exceptions.\n7. **Don’t apply to schools you’re not serious about attending.** Applications are competitive enough. If you get accepted somewhere you know you won’t go, *withdraw your application*. There are too many stressed-out waitlist kids out there for you to take up a spot you don't intend to fill.\n8. **A lot of people lie about college admissions.** Maybe this is just because I go to a competitive school, but it’s real. I know someone who lied about getting into Princeton, Yale, Harvard, and Columbia because they didn’t want to be judged by underclassmen and also fellow classmates. Also, people love to downplay others' success - comments like \"they were just a diversity pick\" or \"Cornell isn’t a real Ivy\" are common (anecdotes from my sister after she committed to Cornell lol).\n9. **People will try to tear you down.** I thought it was just my school, but at UPenn admitted students day, I found out that 3 out of 4 people at my lunch table had someone try to blacklist them from colleges. One person even said someone wrote an entire essay trashing them and sent it to every school they applied to. Colleges are used to this kind of thing. It usually gets deleted or forwarded to your school administration to verify. Also, admissions officers who actually make decisions don't even see this stuff so don't worry. Your chances are not ruined.\n10. **It’s normal to get into only one school.** UPenn was the only T20 I got into. I didn’t get into UMich (a T30), Northwestern (which usually takes a good number of people from my school), or even WashU - all schools that are statistically less selective, but still amazing schools. I also know someone where Yale was the only school they got into (after getting rejected from Princeton REA, which usually has a pretty high deferral rate). It sucks, but don’t freak out. College applications are genuinely such a headache and very random.\n11. **Don’t compare your profile to others on ChanceMe or CollegeResults.** What worked for someone else won’t necessarily work for you. Colleges weigh your background heavily. Someone from a rural area doing research and scoring a 1400 SAT could absolutely get into Harvard. But at a school like TJHSST, you're expected to do much much more given your regional competition.\n\nI’m probably missing a few more points, but these are my main takeaways for now."

That is, how do professors view high schoolers \"doing research\" and applying for research positions with them? Here is a link to a subreddit discussion among professors on the topic as well as some selected posts by professors. The comments by professors at **the following link should really be required reading** for anyone interested in the topic of high schoolers doing research with professors:\n\n[Professors, how do you react when a high school student reaches out for research?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1kvm2pm/professors_how_do_you_react_when_a_high_school/)\n\n(1) \"*I won't consider high school students, even if they're excellent, because I just don't have the time. I already don't have enough time in the day to do the things I have to do (teaching, supervising PhD students, committee meetings...) and can't justify taking time away from those activities to spend on a high school student.*\n\n*I do appreciate the enthusiasm though and will direct them to some activities our department organizes for high school students.\"*\n\n(2) *\"I'm similar. In my case I also have a queue of students at my university waiting to research with me but my group is full.....*\n\n*If I'm saying no to my university students because I'm too busy, it would be insulting to them to turn around and say yes to a high school student that takes even more time. And it would be detrimental to my existing students...\"*\n\n(3) *\"People also forget highschool students are kids. Actually literally kids. Kids are the flakiest mfs around, and I expect that. I taught a highschooler once in a lab internship over the summer and they just ghosted one day, WITH MY FUCKING LAB NOTEBOOK OF REACTIONS. Then 3 months later asked for a referral and if I can help them make a poster for their science fair. I asked for my notebook, \"idk where it went\". Well cool, idk where your poster went. Cut all contact. Never again. But if I was a teenager, would I have done the same? Yeah, probably.*\n\n*So no, dont take highschoolers into your research. Maybe do a workshop day or something.\"*\n\n  \n(4) \"*If it’s a well-written email, I might send an answer giving some pointers to programs our university organizes for high school students, or might offer some quick insights myself, but I’m not going to work with a high-school kid 1-1 or as part of my research group. Also, there are too many side issues involved when working with minors.*\n\n*University starts once you have graduated high school and enroll, not before. It’s simply too early to get involved in ‘real’ research.*\n\n*Nevertheless, I do admire the enthusiasm.*\"\n\n(5) \"*I don’t take volunteers in my lab as they rarely do decent work and volunteer interns just propagate inequities. (Only rich kids can afford to spend their time volunteering instead of working for money.)*\n\n*So I sure as heck am not going to pay a high school student to work in my lab. Lab resources are limited - cash and equipment. I don’t have the time to mentor a student at that stage, nor would I impose they work on my grad students or postdocs who have enough to do already.*\n\n*So, no. Not happening*.\"\n\n(6) \"*I wonder who lied to them about it being a good idea. Minors cannot enter my lab and they cannot touch anything we work with (animal model neuroscience lab). The number of emails I receive has been increasing over the years and it's mostly students from high schools in wealthier areas, which says a lot. Of note is that most PIs in my field want an actual job experience during highschool from undergrads (service jobs, minimum wage), so in that sense lab experience is useless. My lab will always prefer an undergrad who served burgers over summer to someone with \"lab experience\"*\"\n\n(7) \"*I tried it once but the student didn’t actually seem interested in research and more as box to check on their resume. Never again.*\"\n\n(8) \"*I try to send a reply, which is almost always a “sorry, no.” But it’s also the kind of thing that scrolls off the bottom of the email list when things are busy, which was most of the time. I’ve done it a couple of times, had a high school student in the lab. It was a net drain on the lab each time. The students were bright and motivated, but they just didn’t have the time or experience to be of help. We, I, enjoy the teaching aspect, but it doesn’t drive the lab mission forward. It slows us down....*\"\n\n(9) \"*I delete the email. And then spare a minute of frustration for the parents/counselors/whoever told a high school kid they deserve to work with college professors. Look for established programs that do this. Otherwise, our obligations are to our own students. Not gonna work (extra) over the summer to find some way to incorporate a high school kid who knows nothing into my research. It's hard enough doing it for my own undergrads - and is a major waste of time with no upside for high school. It's ok to be in high school and just do high school! You don't need to work with a professor to get ahead or start on college early. Let high school be high school. College will be there for you once you're enrolled as an undergrad.*\"\n\n  \n"

    "body": "30-something Ivy grad lurker here who wanted to share an anecdote that will hopefully put some anxious soul at ease. \n\nWhen I was in high school, I was like many of you here, constantly striving for top grades, test scores athletic and extracurricular achievement at any cost. Fortunately my four years of hard work in high school paid off in dividends and I got into my Ivy dream school. Unfortunately, however, the school I went to was a terrible fit. I was depressed, anxious and alienated from my peers for the vast majority of my time and got very little out of my education that I couldn't have gotten from attending a less selective liberal arts college or state school. \n\nDuring my 20's I ended up working a series of menial jobs before finding work in an 'unpresteigous' white collar setting, then going to a law school, ultimately ending up working for a large corporate law firm. I make a very good, though not exorbitant amount of money and enjoy my work, even as it's highly stressful and frequently a drain on my personal life. \n\nWhile I was fretting about getting top grades and finding my way onto the right path that promised a respectable, financially secure existence in high school, my buddy went the opposite route. He spent most of high school goofing off, getting mediocre grades and middling test scores. He ended up at a mid-tier, non-flagship school where he got his CS degree while working part time at a retail chain store over 5-6 years. \n\nUltimately, over the course of the last decade or so, he slowly but surely honed his skills in a professional setting and on his own time. He eventually ended up joining a local startup not too far from where we grew up (not the Bay) a few years ago. That company just went public and his stock options are now worth tens of millions of dollars and growing. Right now, he's spending his days working out the logistics of a comfortable retirement before 40.\n\nWhile I enjoy my life and don't have any real regrets about how things have shaken out professionally, I'm writing to let you know that attending a top college is not a panacea for your anxieties about future success and that a lack of top college attendance is not a barrier to fabulous success in life. \n\nHas my Ivy League degree helped me in life? Sure, but only on the margins. Law school admissions is much more about GPA and test score than alma mater. My first white collar job is one that I got working my way up from essentially a secretarial position. Corporate law firm recruiting hinges upon first-year law school grades. \n\nA much bigger determination of the successes that my buddy and I have enjoyed were our own choice of skills to cultivate and our own diligence, rather than undergraduate alma mater.\n\nIf you are someone who's posting on this subreddit, you probably belong in the camp of people who are at or near the 99th percentile in conscientiousness. It's that conscientiousness that you carry into your passions and professional interests that will ultimately make or break you, not the name next to your B.A. \n\nWhen people tell you that there's many paths to success, we're not doing it just to assuage any anxieties that you may have about college admissions. We're telling you this because we see your incredible perseverance and intelligence and we don't want you to think that it will somehow go to any degree of waste just because you're not at your dream school.\n\nAll the best during this admissions season. \n\nSincerely,\nSomeone who was in your shoes not too long ago\n\n\n\n"

    "body": "\n26F, CS major. \n\nBasically I come from an immigrant family who expected far too much from me. I had no “dream career” and no interest in doing anything. All these years I’ve literally been bullshiting my way to this point, it somehow worked out through high school and through my first few years in community college but this is as far as I’m getting. It all came at the cost of my mental health. Looking back I never really had a healthy mental state but with college I can certainly say it’s brought it down to rock bottom. I’ve never been officially diagnosed but I’m fairly certainly I have undiagnosed ADHD, bipolar disorder or depression.  Everyday was a fight. It’s fucked me up so much. Ive taken so many gap years, gone through a few major changes and got dismissed twice already and I’m about to be dismissed for the third. \n\nApparently appeals after the third dismissal are typically denied and that’s understandable. Though there is one last option I have which is a “fresh start” program that I believe all colleges offer(?) but I’d have to wait for 3 years to reapply (and it’s only a small selected number of students) but quite honestly I don’t even know if I’ll even want to by then. I legitimately believe I’ve been traumatized, everything related to school just makes me miserable and scared. I can’t even look at a classroom without a chill running down my spine. And anyways, by that time I’ll be nearing 30 and the thought of that alone makes me want to end it all. My whole life wasted on nothing. Straight up a failure. I’m disappointed in myself. I feel pathetic, guilty, lost and i don’t believe I’m stupid but I definitely FEEL stupid. Point is I don’t have much of a choice now than to drop out. I could try to appeal again but if, and that’s a big IF I got readmitted, honestly I still don’t have the motivation. I have around 13-15 more classes to take to graduate but I just don’t have it in me to thug it out and try to finish them anymore. It’d be a stupid waste of money and time. \nThinking about dropping out sounds freeing though. Almost makes me feel happy. I don’t mind it. As corny as this might sound i feel like I’ve been shackled my whole damn life and this is the one time I feel good about doing something but at the same time it’s terrifying. I keep having second thoughts…. Like what happens next ? What direction will I be going in life ? What options do i have ? Not to mention the biggest issue is that I can’t handle everyone’s disappointment. It’s too heavy for me. I genuinely don’t know what to do and I have no one to talk to about this"

Thanks!**\n\nFor the past couple of days, I joined my friend u/[tomatoparticles](https://www.reddit.com/user/tomatoparticles/) in her quest and called 20+ more schools about their waitlist, this is what they said (in order of date that I called them). Shoutout to Cornell, Notre Dame, and Northwestern for not picking up!!!\n\nAlso, as always, *take everything with a grain of salt because different people answering the phone may give different responses.* if there's anything confusing/vague, it's because of the way that the admissions offices answered my questions\n\n**Amherst** (Called on 5/19): there have been very few waitlist offers made so far and they're trying to figure out if they can take anyone else off the waitlist, but If they do, the number will be incredibly small. if they decide to take anyone else off, they will notify them by the end of this week at latest. they said they're trying to get their class wrapped up as quickly as possible\n\n**Syracuse** (5/19): ok so the lady who picked up didn't give me too much info. She said that the admissions committee is working on the waitlist and it goes by space by space availability, so they'll make waitlist offers any time, rather than waves and certain dates. certain departments have taken ppl off so far. She doesn't know if they'll make more offers but she said the admissions office is working hard\n\n**Carnegie Mellon** (5/19): Bad news. They're seeing very limited movement on very specific places being admitted off in the next few weeks/month or so. It's technically possible they will admit anyone, but he said it's very very unlikely that they will be admitting anyone else off the WL. Anyone admitted off the WL fills the spot of someone who decides not to go, so it depends on if a lot of people decide to cancel their enrollment. he just said to take it as pretty much a rejection.\n\n**Columbia** (5/19): This is the second time I called and I got barely any information honestly. The lady who picked up just said they notify ppl no earlier than may 15th and no later than june 30th\n\n**Williams** (5/19): (\\***NOTE: I called them before the select summer waitlist email came out**) There has been no waitlist movement so far for Williams. They are currently in a holding pattern and evaluating everything. If they are able to take students off the waitlist, they will begin making offers as soon as they are able to, if they are closing everyone will get an email. They have till the end of month to finalize everything (IDK if she means finish evaluating the size of the class or make waitlist offers)\n\n**WashU** (5/19): Students have been admitted off the WashU waitlist so far. and you will be notified by email if offered. The lady who picked up didn't know personally if they would be making any more offers. But she said the latest you'll know is by June 30th. All financial awards have already been awarded. Basically all financial aid money has already been spent, so I’m assuming most people accepted off will be full-pay\n\n**UCSD** (5/19): So for UCSD, the next deadline they are looking out for is the July 1st deadline bcuz that's when students send their final transcripts, and some students might like fail classes or lie and be held to cancellations, and they will go to the WL for that. He doesn't know the next time they will admit students, but this is a deadline to look out for. And they usually admit students off in waves. \n\n**UPENN** (5/19): So for UPENN, there has been some waitlist movement so far. There will possibly be more movement until early june but he's not sure. They're doing it on a rolling basis. I didn’t get that much information. \n\n**Lehigh** (5/19): The lady who picked up was so sweet, though I didn't get much info.  She thinks there have been students admitted off the WL so far, but isn't sure. They are evaluating the WL as of this time daily, but are not sure if they will be offering WL acceptances at this time, and notify students of all info on a rolling admissions process.\n\n**NYU** (Called on 5/20): The student intern who picked up said that there have been a decent amount of people that have gotten off so far, and they anticipate taking a decent amount of people off each year. He anticipates there being more WL acceptances, even in June (he said they just got a phone call regarding the waitlist from NYU itself and that's why he thinks there will be acceptances in June). They do rolling admissions, and there's no stern specific or school specific answers.\n\n**Stanford** (5/20): They haven’t gone to the waitlist yet– they also haven’t finished analyzing/processing who chose to come and who didn't, meaning they haven’t determined yet if they will need to go to the waitlist. they’ll try to get everything out as soon as possible though!\n\n**Pomona** (5/20): For Pomona, They've taken a very very small group of students off the waitlist so far. They're still monitoring it, and they may take more students off or not–they're still evaluating the WL. He does not know if there will be more acceptances and he said it's basically a waiting game. He's not sure if/when at all they will take more students off. They do rolling admissions. They do consider demonstrated interest when going to the waitlist so they do care about waitlist updates/LOCI and stuff (tho they don't care whether you need aid or not).\n\n**Bates** (5/20): For Bates, there has been waitlist activity so far and contact with waitlist students. And if they're interested in a student being selected off the waitlist, they will get a phone call firstly to see if the student is interested in a WL, and they will have 48 hours to respond. It's very random and they don't have waves. They can keep the WL open as long as August 1st, which is rare, but she says there have been cases where it drags on. They're still making phone calls so she thinks there will be more acceptances, so she said pay close attention to your phone and make sure your voicemail is clear. They basically read all applications all over again so every single app gets a fresh read.\n\n**John Hopkins** (5/20): ok the person who picked up was a student intern so i didn't get much info. She couldn't transfer my call to an AO cuz most of them work from home. She said it's very likely that someone has been admitted off, and that the waitlist is “very much rolling”. And they're aso waiting for people to reply to their admissions. Sometimes people get accepted off even in June\n\n**UT Austin** (5/20): Some admitted have been admitted off the UT Austin waitlist so far. The AO has not seen anyone admitted for ECE, he thinks it’ll be fewer since it’s a popular major. They do anticipate taking more students off the WL. The latest you will notify a student about a WL acceptance is mid July, but they'll have fewer openings for WL in July. You’ll probably see the largest number of spaces open in the current timeframe. As I said before, it’s less and less likely you will hear as you proceed throughout July. They do rolling admissions. They don’t look at financial need when admitting off the WL but they look at the rating of their initial application and waitlist updates that you send them \n\n**Emory** (5/20): They sent out a waitlist update a few weeks ago to waitlisted students. They have accepted abt 95 students from the waitlist so far. They are continuing to notify students in waves and anticipate making more waitlist acceptances in the future. \n\n**Harvard** (5/20): For Harvard, there have been a few students admitted off the waitlist so far, and some have been released/removed off the WL. If you have not received notice that you have been released/removed off the waitlist, you are still on the waitlist. She didn’t have much other info, she said you just have to wait and see and it’s still active. They accept students off in waves and they’ve only done one round of waves so far. \n\n**Tufts** (5/20): Ok for tufts I didn’t get much info. They have admitted students off the waitlist recently, but she didn’t know how much. And it’s on a rolling basis. They don’t know if they will take anyone else off as of rn.\n\n**UMich** (5/20): UMICH has made some waitlist decisions, however they have not made all decisions at this time because they’re monitoring their enrollment. They’re continuing to monitor that, they historically expect to finalize all waitlist decisions by mid June. He said historically the number of students admitted off the WL tends to hover about 0.5% of all students who are on the WL. They usually send a mass wave of decisions on one singular day, but sometimes it takes 2 or 4 days. They don’t need any other waitlist updates or anything, if they need anything the office will reach out\n\n**Princeton** (5/20): They've admitted a very small number off the Princeton waitlist so far. He doesn't know if there will be more waitlist acceptances in the future but it's a possibility that there's a very small number of future students who get off. They do rolling admissions/as a needed basis as space becomes available.\n\n**UCSB** (5/22): The lady who picked up said that there have been some students admitted off. Most students admitted off historically are in the college of engineering. They are still making decisions about how many ppl they can take off the WL. They’re hoping to make decisions by the end of June. She said it's an ever-evolving landscape, so they’re not sure abt the final date they can send decisions. She said it’s too early in the process so far to determine if they will take any more students off/how many students they will take off. \n\n**UCLA (5/22)**: They have already started taking students off the waitlist, and they likely will continue until the end of summer. They evaluate the waitlist weekly. They look at everyone on the waitlist at the same time when making decisions. \n\nIf anyone has any requests, PM me. Please be patient tho bcuz I have like 30 requests for schools right now and I’m just going down the list"

    "body": "  \n(TL;DR: Very sick student has great academics, but very little ECs, due to extremely limited time and resources because of the chronic illness.)\n\nTL;DR for my stats:  36 ACT, 4.0 unweighted GPA, 4.73 weighted GPA, 14 APs, class rank #1 of \\~1100\n\n\n\nHey all, I have quite the irregular situation regarding my high school career, and I heard this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice.\n\nI am planning on applying to Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Duke, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UChicago, and a few safeties within my home state. I am interested in majoring in business management, economics, finance, or something similar within that field. I would absolutely love to go to a great school like the ones mentioned above, but I can accept staying home to attend one of my safety schools full-ride if necessary (either due to my health problems persisting into next year or due to being rejected from my reach schools).\n\nI am a student from a public high school who has faced a tremendously difficult health problem the last 2 years of my life. It has left me bedridden for half of my sophomore year and the entirety of my junior year, although I am thankfully able to be just healthy enough to attend in-person school for my senior year. I am an academically inclined student with a 36 ACT composite score (36E 36M 36R 36S), a 4.73 Weighted GPA out of 4, and I will most likely be selected as valedictorian of my graduating class of \\~1100 students. I will have taken 14 APs by the end of my senior year, 3 of which have been completely self-studied. (Sadly, I was too sick to take any of the AP tests the last two years, so I won't have any of those AP scores until the end of my senior year.)\n\nHowever, due to my extenuating circumstances, I was only able to do anything for around 2-4 hours a day, so all of that time went towards completing my coursework for online school. As such, I have no school or sport-affiliated extracurriculars. While I was sick, I conducted extensive medical research in collaboration with several medical experts, in an attempt to determine what was causing my severe health problems, so that could potentially work as some sort of extracurricular. I did also wrestle at the beginning of my Sophomore year, right before I fell ill, but nothing other than that during sophomore and junior years. However, since I am well enough to attend school this year, I have joined several clubs, such as my school's math competition prep club (for competing in events such as AMC), DECA, my school's Speech and Debate team, and a few other clubs here and there.\n\nI have been told that most of the best schools value unique or interesting personal stories, but I have also heard that they place a heavy emphasis on extracurriculars as well. I am not sure which is the most true, or if it is a mixture of both. For my personal essays, I talked about the lessons learned from my illness, and how it has improved and strengthened my character. (That was one of the Common App personal essay prompts.) I feel like I have a pretty unique personal story, but I don't know if it is enough to make up for the gap in my application where extracurriculars should be.\n\nSince I present such a strange case, I face quite the dilemma in regards to my college application process. My health problems have severely reduced my ability to participate in extracurriculars, and unfortunately significantly inhibits my cognitive capabilities, so it is harder for me to complete coursework and perform well on standardized testing. (If I hadn't fallen ill, I would have done much more, both in regards to academics and extracurriculars.) Do you think college admissions offices would find these circumstances as a fair justification to my lack of extracurriculars? I have heard mixed responses from my counselors and family friends who have worked with college admission officers, so I really don't know what to expect going into the application process for such prestigious institutions. Any advice or input is greatly appreciated, and I am willing to provide any more information, if needed. Thank you so much for taking the time to help me!\n\n(Sorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to make sure I presented all relevant information)\n\nIf you can, please interact with this post, so more people can see it. I would love to get as many perspectives and opinions as possible here!\n\n"

    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1h78a6y/how_to_cope_with_possibility_of_ed_deferral_or/",
    "body": "For most colleges, ED and REA decisions will come out sometime next week.\n\nI have already seen questions where people have been wondering how to cope with the possibility of rejection - or even deferral - from their ED or REA school.\n\nFirst of all, I want to acknowledge how difficult this period of time may be in your life. For many of you, this is the first big decision that is out of your control in your life.\n\nThat being said, here are some things to remember that might help you deal with the reality of a deferral or rejection.\n\n1. Statistically, the odds of your getting into a T20 school are very low. The very best odds are that roughly 9 in 10 people are rejected. For T5s, the rejection rate is something like 97 in 100 people.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of the people applying are academically qualified, being rejected from a T20 is not a commentary on your academic ability or capability of succeeding.\n\nThe number of spots at T20s has not grown with the demand for these spots.\n\nThe vast majority of applicants are capable of succeeding at top schools; there just aren't enough slots for all of you.\n\n2) A deferral or rejection is not a commentary on your worth as a human being. These colleges are rejecting an approximation of you on paper based on stats, ECs, LORs, essays, etc.\n\nThis approximation can never account for all of your good qualities or your worth as a person.\n\nYou are still the same good person with the same positive qualities no matter what the admissions committee decides.\n\n3) For the vast majority of careers and situations, where you go to college is of little consequence.\n\nWith the exception of fields like finance, consulting, politics, and a few others, where you go to college is of little consequence to your eventual career.\n\nWhile your college may help you get your first job, after that point, you are largely judged based on your ability to perform tasks associated with that job, as well as your soft skills.\n\nNo one has ever cared that I graduated from Reed College, not the T20 or T10 LAC I was initially accepted to.\n\nA study was done of people who got into a T20 and attended vs. those who were admitted to a T20 and chose not to attend. The outcomes were exactly the same, meaning that success is more about what you bring to the table, rather than where you go to school.\n\n4) The dream school you have been fantasizing about isn't really a dream. I got into my dream grad program at Columbia. No matter how good my experience was, it could never live up to the expectations in my mind.\n\nI have donated to Columbia, but I can still name 11 things I don't like about Columbia University off the top of my head. That is to say, even if you have a great experience, there will still be aspects of college life that annoy the hell out of you.\n\nIt's easier to cope with rejection - or even deferral - when you realize that you are idealizing your dream school and that magical place is a real institution of higher education with very real flaws.\n\n5) Your problems won't magically disappear if you get accepted to your dream school.\n\nFor whatever reason, the myth has been propagated that all your problems disappear once you get admitted to your dream school.\n\nIn this myth, getting rejected from their dream school means that you will essentially be stuck with all of your current problems.\n\nThe reality is that for most people, the problems you are dealing with now will be the problems you deal with in college. Your depression or anxiety won't go away once you get into your dream school. You will likely be depressed or anxious about other things, just not getting into a T20.\n\nFamily tragedies and the deaths of grandparents will happen no matter if you go to HYPSM or your average state school.\n\nIf you are stressed right now, your stress won't magically go away if you get accepted to your dream school. Matter of fact, you will likely go from being stressed about high school to being stressed about college.\n\nThe vast majority of your problems will still exist regardless of the outcome of ED or REA.\n\n6) In the case that you get deferred, it may fill you with doubt and be very painful, especially if you thought you were going to be accepted.\n\nWhen I was in high school and the school was much less selective, my high school counselor thought I was a lock for UChicago. I applied EA - that was the only early option back then - and I was deferred. Even my high school counselor was surprised.\n\nIt turns out I was accepted after being deferred.\n\nJust because you are deferred early doesn't mean you won't be accepted come April.\n\ntl;dr Getting rejected or deferred from your ED or REA school isn't the end of the world or a question of your ability to succeed academically or your character. Where you go to school doesn't matter for most jobs. You can have a great life even if you go to a T100, not a T20.\n\nGood luck with your decision(s); I hope it goes well for you."

    "body": "Despite the title, I'm genuinely so serious about this, although it is somewhat true LOL. As you all know, the college commitment deadline, May 1st, is in less than a week, but I still haven’t committed to a college yet. I'm having a really tough time deciding where to commit and would love any advice.\n\nI’m currently considering these four colleges:\n\n1. **RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology)** \n\n**Major**: Computer Engineering\n\n2. **Purdue University**; Purdue Polytechnic Institute at Purdue University in West Lafayette \n\n**Major**: Computer Engineering\n\n3. **NYU**; Tandon School of Engineering\n\n**Major**: Electrical & Computer Engineering\n\n4. **NEU (Northeastern University)**; Khoury College of Computer Science, Oakland first year → Boston\n\n**Major**: Computer Science\n\nHere are some of the important factors I’m considering and concerns I have about these schools:\n\n**MAJOR:**\n\nWhen I applied to college, I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to major in computer SCIENCE or computer ENGINEERING, and honestly, I’m still not very sure. I don’t know which one is more suitable for me. I took APCSA this year, and honestly, I did not like it. BUT, I can definitely recount times where I’ve really enjoyed coding, so I’m not sure if this class was an exception/anomaly. OVERALL, I’M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT WHAT MAJOR I WANT TO DO, BUT I DEFINITELY KNOW IT’S WITHIN THE STEM FIELD. \n\nJust in case, I’d also like to know how easy it is to switch majors at these schools (both within and between schools).\n\n**RANKING:**\n\n**NYU**: I’ve heard some mixed opinions on Tandon’s reputation. While NYU seems way more selective, the ranking for Tandon is #27 for CS and #42 for engineering on US News. If I wanted to switch to CS within Tandon, how hard would that be? \n\n**NEU**: For NEU, I heard that they’re changing their entire curriculum soon, and it feels a little risky since I don’t know how that’ll turn out. I’ve also heard a lot of criticism on NEU’s acceptance rate/ranking inflation, and the fact that they still haven’t sent me my financial aid package is not helping 💀. \n\n**Purdue**: Though I have a few concerns about the school (read in “Social Life/Campus Life”), Purdue is ranked very highly for engineering, so I’m wondering if the strength of the program compensates for those concerns.\n\n**RIT**: It’s the cheapest option, and it’s ranked #6 for co-op programs, but I’m not sure if I can see myself staying there for all 4 years. If I go to RIT, I’d probably want to transfer out after the first year. Does anyone know how hard it is to transfer from RIT into a better-ranked school as a CS/CE major, and whether I should just try to transfer no matter where I go for my first year?\n\n**FINANCIAL AID**:\n\nIn terms of financial aid, the cost goes:\n\n1. **RIT**, 21k\n2. **Purdue**, 50k\n3. **NYU**, 70k\n4. **NEU**; haven’t received my financial aid package yet\n\nAlthough cost IS a factor that I’m considering while making this decision, if the opportunities, experiences, and education is better at a school that is more expensive, I’m willing to invest in that. Additionally, I’ve heard of people who have gotten co-ops or internships that lower the cost of their tuition, and sometimes even cover it entirely. I want to know if this is realistic for me at my more expensive schools. \n\n**LOCATION**:\n\nI live in NY, and while my parents want me to stay close, it isn’t super high on my priority list.\n\n* **NYU**: less than an hour drive\n* **NEU**: 3-hour drive\n* **RIT**: 6-hour drive\n* **Purdue**: All the way in Indiana (so via plane)\n\n**SOCIAL LIFE/CAMPUS LIFE:**\n\nI haven’t visited any of these schools, so I’m not very familiar with the campus and social life (please give thoughts on this, especially if you’re a current student!!)\n\n* **NYU**: I got into NYU as a spring semester admit. I’m worried that this will affect my ability to make friends, find roommates, and get involved. Does anyone know how spring admits usually handle housing and social life? Can I dorm with people who started in the fall? Also, what do spring admits even do during the fall semester?\n* **NEU**: I’d be starting at the Oakland campus for my first year, and then transferring to Boston. I feel like I’d be missing out socially by not being in Boston my first year. How’s the transition process and how is Oakland?\n* **Purdue**: It’s a very rural place, so I’m worried that it might feel isolating or overwhelming to me, considering I’ve spent my entire life in NYC.\n\n**SUMMARY**:\n\n* Overall, how do these schools compare for Computer Science/Engineering (and electrical for NYU)?\n* How easy is it to switch majors at each school?\n* Which school best prepares you for your future and offers the most opportunities or co-op/internships?\n* What are the social scenes like, especially for spring admits at NYU and Oakland campus students at NEU?\n* How much should I care about the rankings/reputation?\n* Are these tuitions worth it?\n* How easy is it to transfer out of any of these schools if I don’t feel like it’s the best fit?\n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTE:**\n\n* I did get a **guaranteed admission for fall 2026 to BU** (College of Engineering for CE); is this worth transferring into? \n\nThank you so much to anyone who took the time to read all this 😢 I really appreciate any advice or personal experiences you have!\n\n**UPDATE INQUIRY:**\n\nTHANK YOU FOR ALL THE RESPONSES AND ADVICE. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT! After reading all the suggestions, Purdue is definitely coming on top. However, I did see a few comments talking about Purdue Polytechnic vs Purdue College of Engineering. From what I understand, Purdue College of Engineering offers a more traditional and rigorous engineering program, and Purdue Polytechnic seems to have a more applied, hands-on approach, but overall, less prestigious than the College of Engineering. That said, I’m wondering if Purdue Polytechnic is still the strongest choice? Is it hard to transfer to the College of Engineering?\n\nAlso a lot of people are saying RIT is great for co-ops, what about NEU? It's ranked higher in terms of co-op, is it the same or better?"

    "body": "Yesterday UMich made two pretty huge announcements. First, they're rolling out an ED option for Fall '26 cycle.\n\nI think ED at Michigan will affect a lot of folks here. Why?\n\nBecause if I know half of you half as well as I should like, and half of you half as well as you deserve, many of you were probably looking at Michigan as a target-reach and planning to apply EA because of the uncommon bump EA applications received in their pool.\n\n(And you were probably looking at their engineering programs or at Ross. We'll get to that in a second.)\n\nBut now with UMich ED, I can only guess the EA bump will go away and the RD round will be tougher. And more of you will probably be making a hard decision about using your ED on Michigan vs. shooting your shot at Cornell or CMU or Rice or Stanford REA.\n\nMich ED is also an interesting shift because relatively few top publics (with the exception of UVA?) have an ED option.\n\n❌ UC Berkeley, UCLA, UTA, UNC, UW, Purdue, UIUC ❌  None of those have ED—partly because, as state schools, they ostensibly focus on in-state students. ED, being an application choice that biases toward a wealthier national audience, undermines that priority.\n\nAdopting ED positions Michigan more like a private university in strategy: they are aiming to increase yield and selectivity at the cost of accessibility.\n\nSecond announcement was a new major program: \"The College of Engineering and the Stephen M. Ross School of Business will join in an integrated business and engineering dual-degree program, which combines a Bachelor of Business Administration with a Bachelor of Science in any engineering major.\"\n\nSo, that's another big strategic move from Michigan. I know a lot of you apply to Ross and even more of you apply to their engineering college. I think this move is speaking directly to A2C hooligans.\n\nI would guess we're going to be seeing a lot more schools adopt this specific kind of joint program, bringing together business and engineering/CS.\n\n**What I think this means for admissions more broadly**\n\nI think this is a bellweather for all undegrad admissions. Specifically, I think we're going to see more schools (even public systems) trying to control yield by rolling out ED **while at the same time** creating mega-strategic joint degree/interdisciplinary programs that cater to STEM and business tracks.\n\nI think this is an interesting conversation to have on this sub specifically because of how directly these moves speak to the user base (y'all).\n\nThoughts?"

You now have quite a few items to tick off your to-do list.\n\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT:  Don't out if you're already a rising senior -- (or even a fall semester senior for that matter if you’re reading this much later). You still have plenty of time.\n\nPlease note that my views about what to do when and what I emphasize might be different from the advice you hear from other sources and other students, counselors, or consultants. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.\n\nHere’s how I suggest you tackle this list. If you are new to admissions, no matter where you are in high school, start reading here from the beginning. Don’t panic. It’s totally ok if you haven’t done any of the stuff on the list. Most kids haven’t. I’m just providing a timeline for “an ideal world” situation.\n\n# Rising Junior Summer (Summer before Junior Year)\n\nENJOY YOUR SUMMER: This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. Be sure to take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nACTIVITIES: I love what MIT Admissions says: \"Some students feel so much pressure to get into the “right” college that they want to make sure they do everything right—down to their extracurricular activities. Fortunately, the only right answer is to do what’s right for you—not what you think is right for us. Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don’t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy—whether it feels right for you. College is not a costume party; you’re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you’ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you’re ready to try.”\n\nGET INVOLVED WITH STUFF\n\n* Yourself (Exercise healthy habits, engage in personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, get a job, learn something new that’s good for your brains like guitar or Italian, practice mindfulness and meditation).\n* Your family (Help with sibs or grandparents, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, or take care of dinner one night a week).\n* Your community (Community service can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects. Volunteer to play your instrument or play games at a retirement home, coach a kids’ team, make sandwiches at a food bank, or make comfort bags and drop off healthy snacks and water to people who might not have access to housing).\n\nGET A SUMMER JOB: Just an old-fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.\n\nTESTING\n\n* PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT: You take it in October, and it helps you qualify for National Merit if you score high enough.\n* PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT: Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of your junior year. Definitely take one in the early part of the spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start your senior year.\n* Even though many colleges are continuing to be Test Optional, I encourage you to continue to prep for and take the tests because the list of colleges requiring tests is changing.\n\nSTART YOUR RESUME: If you haven’t already, make a list of all the activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. I suggest making a spreadsheet, where you have columns for the name of the activity, your title, your leadership, your impact, lessons learned or impact on you, years that you've been involved, and an estimate of your hours per week. Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old-fashioned summer or part-time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to more traditional research, internships, and in-or-out-of-school clubs and sports.\n\nEXPLORE THE WORLD OF ADMISSIONS: Read some college admissions websites and blogs. Some of my favorites are Georgia Tech, MIT, Tulane, UVA, Johns Hopkins, and Tufts. They are open about the realities and anxieties of college admissions.\n\n# Junior Fall\n\nPretty much all of the summer stuff still applies.\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nTAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN: You can read more about Course Selection [in my post, Making your Course Selections Count](https://admissionsmom.college/course-selection/making-your-course-selections-count-2023/). Colleges say your course rigor counts for more than your GPA and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. I recommend that you take four years of:\n\n* Science (including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)\n* Foreign Language (many highly selective colleges like to see four years of a foreign language during high school. I know you don’t want to. It’s also good for your brain. [Here’s a doc with my explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6EB7rSSrDV6ovPjl3ndD8Vc17cYt4Wlo3YkA5kiLOo/edit?usp=sharing))\n* English\n* Math (ending in Calculus if it’s available and offered (especially if you want to be competitive for highly rejective colleges) -- or higher)\n* Social Science (History, Gov, etc)\n\nCheck out the course requirements or suggestions on the web pages of some colleges that might interest you.\n\nGET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS: Visit them during office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. Speak up in class. Ask for help when you need it. Be polite. Say thank you after class. Acknowledge their hard work and use their wisdom.\n\nKEEP UP YOUR GRADES: I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials. Meet with your teachers after class. Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other YouTube videos if you’re struggling. Don’t wait and get far behind. Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now.\n\nREAD READ READ: Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. Read real books, magazines, newspapers, and more real books. Read books that are required for school and books just for fun. I can suggest lots — ask me! READ FICTION!!!!\n\nKEEP PREPPING AND PRACTICING FOR THE ACT AND SAT: Start your testing in the late fall or early spring of Junior Year if it’s available to you.\n\nSTAY INVOLVED: Keep up with everything I listed for summer (involved with yourself, your family, your community). [I talk at length about extracurricular activities and finding your star-shaped self in this post](https://admissionsmom.college/activities/). Get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or simply do individual activities that add to your school environment. Sit with someone new at lunch once a week. Make an effort to say hello to two new people a week. Find a need and fill it. Or, as [this Georgia Tech blog says,](https://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) find what makes you happy, and do it.\n\nCHECK-IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR: See what they have to advise and how the process works at your school. Every school is slightly different. Let them get to know you, too.\n\n# Junior Spring\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nLETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. Some colleges have certain expectations for recommenders, so be sure to read college admissions websites about what they are looking for. For lots more in-depth info, [here’s a post about getting those Letters of Recommendation. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nCOLLEGE VISITS: Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you might consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Hang out on campus. Then, if you can go on college visits to schools you might find interesting, do so.\n\n* Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also wander around.\n* Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear?\n* Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night. Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospective student and, even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Move on and find a kinder person.\n* Check out the dining hall and the gym.\n* Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one. Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable.\n* If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get a feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.\n\nVIRTUAL VISITS: Most colleges have really upped their game when it comes to virtual tours, online info sessions, and their social media presence, so be sure to check out all the ways they are bringing their college to you on their websites.\n\nCOLLEGE LIST: Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but you can also learn a lot on the internet, social media, and by reading books. Besides virtual and live tours and info sessions, you can learn more about colleges here:\n\n* Reddit: here on r/ApplyingToCollege, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.\n* Colleges’ websites. Sign up to receive info and get on their mailing lists.\n* Common Data Set. Google “college name” and “common data set”\n* Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on Instagram, and Twitter, and TikTok. Clean up your account and use your real name\n* Colleges’ newspapers and news feeds\n* “The Best 300 Something Colleges” by Princeton Review\n* Trans and GenderQueer Friends, [this post is for you.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_oYp5PlIgVSVe9GTRrvcpBLmPy4emBqV/view?usp=drive_link)\n* Books! See below\n\nSOMETHING TO CONSIDER: Your SureFire Sure Bet Welcoming School -- Make sure you have at least one Sure-Fire Sure Bet Welcoming School and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity. A sure-fire safety school is a school:\n\n* where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions\n* AND you would like to go there\n* AND they are a financial safety\n* Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure-fire safety until you have already been admitted.\n\nI like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety out of the way. You must LOVE your safety. Research it and imagine yourself there. Remember the strength of your application is only as strong as your list. An unbalanced list is weak and will usually not be strong enough to hold up your college admissions experience.\n\nCOLLEGE FIT: Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big old list. Having a ton of schools on this initial list is ok. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter some of the schools out. Here’s the [link to my Step By Step Guide to Creating your List](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/whq4tn/seniors_two_posts_in_one_1_if_youre_feeling_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that goes into much more detail about finding colleges that fit you. [Check out this post filled with various college lists for you to explore.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pG1biX7AjKd3YH9LtSvdHg7jMW2zCBwE?usp=sharing)\n\nADMISSIONSMOM'S COLLEGE BOOK CLUB: (I don’t actually have a book club, but I wish I did. These are just a list of books you should read.) Here are a few of the books I recommend: *College Match* by Steve Antonoff, *The Fiske Guide*, *Colleges that Change Lives*, *Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be* by Frank Bruni, and, of course, [Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit, 2023 Updates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OB7agF8xFavMGxZ-nVrQKhAXh6yLh8Bp/view?usp=sharing) by me - (this is a link to the pdf for free, but you can also buy it at your fave booksellers if you want to hold it in your hands or read it on your kindle!).\n\nCOLLEGE RESEARCH SPREADSHEET: Include info like test score averages, requirements, distance from home, school size, programs that might interest you, climate, and anything else you feel might be important.\n\nNO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE OR TIME: Make a No College-Talk Zone or Time in your house. In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it. For other families I know, it might be all day on Sundays. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year. Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your home for the next year. That’s not healthy for any of you.\n\nNET PRICE CALCULATORS: Sit down with your parents and do the net price calculators for a few colleges on your list. Begin those tough financial conversations. Be sure to use the one provided on the college page itself. You can usually find it pretty easily by googling: “College Name Net Price Calculator).\n\nNEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS: Make a new college-only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! I recommend this because then all your info from colleges won’t get mixed up in your other emails. Also, colleges prefer to see a college email address so they can know you’ll still have it after school is out. Only use this email address for colleges you’re applying to (or considering applying to) and your Application Platforms like Common App or UC Apps. I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to this email address if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes, so you don't miss important info! [Be sure you’ve signed up for “more info” or to “request info” on the college’s websites with your new college email address,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing)\n\nCHECK-IN WITH YOUR SCHOOL/COLLEGE COUNSELOR: They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have its own processes you need to follow.\n\nCOLLEGE INFO SESSIONS: If a college comes to your town or close to your town or school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in. Also, be sure to check out all the amazing virtual opportunities.\n\nCOLLEGE FAIRS: Go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.\n\nWRITE: I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what? It’s not! Even the most timid of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early. I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.\n\n* Write Every Day. Even if it’s just a sentence or two.\n* Read and listen to essays on [This I Believe](https://www.thisibelieve.org/). These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects. I like that they aren't college essays.\n* Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on Reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you.\n* Avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays, and often when you read those, you can get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive, boring essays for the reader.\n* Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources.\n\nREAD BOOKS: Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes. Reading good fiction and also self-help books will help you learn to discover your voice. Here’s a list of fantastic books to read. Some are just for fun, and others help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing, and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays. [Here's a great post by](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nwij3j/books_to_read_that_mention_the_college_admissions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [u/SplendidCheese](https://www.reddit.com/u/SplendidCheese/), where they highlight some fun fiction books about college admissions. I've included a few in my list here, too.\n\n* *Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics* by Dan Harris and Jeff Warren\n   * *The Happiness Equation* by Neil Pasricha\n   * *You are a Badass* by Jenn Sincero\n   * *Brave Enough, Wild,* and *Tiny Beautiful Things* \\-- all by Cheryl Strayed\n   * *The Soul of an Octopus* (just finished it and loved it!)\n   * *Me and Earl and the Dying Girl* by Jesse Andrews ( I like his voice and it’s on a lot of banned book lists!.)\n   * *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig\n   * *Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow* by Gabrielle Zevin\n   * *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir\n   * *Lessons in Chemistry* by Bonnie Garmus\n   * Some fun fiction books about College Admissions:\n      * *This is Not a Personal Statemen*t by Tracy Badua\n      * *The Ivies* by Alexa Donne -- A2C gets a shout-out!\n      * *Girls with Bright Futures* by Tracy Dobmeier and Wendy Katzman\n\n* *Admission* by Julie Buxbaum\n\n* *Where the Grass is Green and The Girls are Pretty* by Lauren Weisberger\n\nTAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER: Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key. There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad. So, how do you deal with it? What do you do -- besides post and comment on a2c??? :))\n\n* [You are a BadAss College Applicant:](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/2024-college-admissions-decisions-wind-and-a-little-stress?r=3qhdg3) A post with a metaphor about baby trees and college stress.\n* [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n* Be involved. And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.\n* LEAN IN. Lean into your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress. Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it. Instead, face it and embrace it. If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience is so much about the journey and not the outcome. And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a particular school.\n* Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air. Eat Healthy Food\n\nOTHER… If you qualify, explore these amazing programs and possible options if you’re not already:\n\n* QuestBridge Program: [https://www.questbridge.org/](https://www.questbridge.org/)\n* Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program:[ http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/](https://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/)\n* The Posse Foundation: [https://www.possefoundation.org/](https://www.possefoundation.org/)\n\nJuniors, you are in for the journey of your lives. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible. Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming. Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger. I'm looking forward to watching your transformations! This is a prime opportunity for you to take advantage of digging in and getting to know who you are.\n\n# Rising Senior Summer\n\nThis is an important summer for you, but there is no magical formula of what you need to or have to do to get into any colleges-- even the most highly selective ones. Sure, you can research in a lab, get an internship, or do a program somewhere on campus or around the world. Those are all fantastic ways to spend your summer. You can also do independent projects – and I think you should – even in addition to whatever else you might be doing.\n\nBut, don’t forget the good old-fashioned summer job. You can actually stand out from the applicant crowd these days by making a smoothie, flipping a burger, or scooping ice cream. These kinds of jobs allow you to learn about taking care of others and listening to what the customer wants, learn about organizing your thoughts and activities, learn to work with others, and gain some experiences you might never have the chance to gain again.\n\nHere’s what William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Harvard Admissions, has said about summer: “Bring summer back... Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e., to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead.”\n\nFINISH TESTING: SAT and ACT (if possible)\n\nRECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES: Take time to care for your mental health and your body. Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Breathe. \n\nCOLLEGE-ONLY EMAIL ADDRESS: If you haven’t yet, be sure to make a college-only email address that you use for your applications and communications with colleges. See above in JUNIOR SPRING for a longer explanation.\n\nWRITE: “Write like a motherf\\*cker,” as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself. Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. See my WRITE from Junior Spring.\n\n[Here’s a list of questions to get you going](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LviZQkEwVd6_SY4-XlCMRpVRiCDL_rdC/view?usp=sharing). This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1. Check out [themostdangerouswritingapp.com](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app). Start asking yourself some hard and kinda silly questions. I’ve had students write stunning essays just by answering these questions:\n\n* What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?\n* What do you worry about?\n* What’s your secret sauce?\n* What’s your superpower?\n* When you’re in your room at night, what do you look at?\n* What makes you smile?\n\nTHINK ABOUT AND PRACTICE WRITING THE PERSONAL ESSAY: Remember — no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message — the topic is YOU. Focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are. Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader. You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value. They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application. Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources.\n\nMAKE A COMMON APP/COALITION ACCOUNT & any other accounts you might need: Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background. Those roll over when they update the website in August. DO NOT fill out college-specific info. It could be lost. Write your essays in a google doc. Do not write them in the app!\n\nUPDATE YOUR RESUME: Or create it if you haven’t done so yet. [Here’s a sample I use.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MaObJv_8g3lIGj_80n97Wg36MVib2RaiLX8g3f76rc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nVISIT COLLEGES if you can: See information about College Visits and Virtual Visits in the Junior Spring section.\n\nSTART YOUR COLLEGE LIST: [Here’s a post about creating your college list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/whq4tn/seniors_two_posts_in_one_1_if_youre_feeling_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[.](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/my-2024-guide-to-building-the-best-college-list?r=3qhdg3) Start narrowing down your list — including a wide range of selectivities. Make sure you have at least three SFSB Welcoming Schools. What is a SureFire SureBet Welcoming School you ask? Well, it’s often your most important school. It’s one:\n\n* Where you have direct/auto/guaranteed admissions based on your stats\n* OR you’ve already been admitted via ED, EA, or Rolling\n* AND you can see yourself being happy there\n* AND it works financially for you and your family.\n\nREALITY CHECKS: You hear me say time and time -- time again -- that you cannot expect to be accepted to the most highly rejective colleges in the country -- no matter how brilliant your application and shiny and sparkly your essays and ECs and LORs are. I’m not saying don’t apply -- Do apply. Clearly, some of you will get in and I’m here for that. I’m just saying there are too many amazing yous out there, so you absolutely can not expect it. You’re a brilliant generation -- and now you’re gonna have to figure out a way to share your brilliance in ways beyond a tiny teacup of colleges that a defunct magazine ranks in order to stay relevant.\n\nKEEP IN TOUCH WITH COLLEGES: [Sign up to \"request info\" from every college you’re interested in](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing) — even if you’re already getting info from them because they bought it from a testing company. Use your college-admissions-only email address for this. Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Instagram and Twitter for the colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following Common App, too. Also, it’s ok to occasionally contact your regional college admissions officers or the general admissions office with questions.\n\n# Senior Fall\n\nAll of the above....plus:\n\nFinish up any college visits (or virtual visits) especially for EARLY DECISION POSSIBILITIES.\n\nCOLLEGE LIST: Begin to narrow your college list. [Make sure your list is balanced](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vuing4/its_all_about_finding_your_balanced_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and you have three SureFire SureBet Welcoming Schools (see above) that you love and that will be good financial fits, as well as a collection of matches, reaches, and lotteries (if that’s your thing). \n\nDEMONSTRATED INTEREST: Check the Common Data set to see whether the colleges on your list consider demonstrated interest. If they do, make sure you open and read every email they send you, click on links they send you, and spend some time researching on their websites. Also, go to webinars, campus visits if you can, virtual visits, and reach out to admissions with any questions you have.\n\nCOLLEGE APPLICATION SPREADSHEET: Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics — and look for overlap. Testing info.\n\nFILLING OUT APPLICATIONS: Start with the details if you didn't do it in the summer. Fill out activities, family history, etc.\n\nEARLY ACTION: Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available and that you can by following guidelines. Make a calendar of deadlines and essay requirements and work through them one by one.\n\nFAFSA AND CSS: Make accounts and start gathering and filling out information.\n\nFINANCIAL AID: Reach out to the financial aid offices of schools on your list and establish a relationship with them. Do the net price calculators on the college websites with your parents.\n\nLETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and \"cheat sheet\" if you haven't yet.)[ See linked LOR Post for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nYOUR SCHOOL COUNSELOR: Check in with your school counselor. They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have its own processes that you need to follow.\n\nSAT/ACT TESTS: Finish up any testing you have left to do. Be sure to check colleges’ websites for their last accepted testing dates.\n\nSUBMIT TEST SCORES: Submit your test scores in plenty of time for deadlines to the schools that don't allow self-report. Be sure to check the colleges’ admissions websites to find when they need to be submitted and whether they allow self-reporting or not. And for colleges that are test-optional, do your research to figure out whether you should or should not report. You can use the Common Data Set to see where your scores fit in. Use [www.fairtest.org](https://www.fairtest.org/) to find out whether a college is test-optional or not. [Here’s a link to my copy/paste I share with students when they ask about submitting scores.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnzg3Kc6cP08XxpYi6Slpjh-YhLIeqDHLNZK09z9WBM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAP SCORES: I suggest self-reporting AP scores of 4s and 5s and sometimes 3s. [Here’s my post about APs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ug130e/lets_talk_about_ap_tests_and_scores/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nESSAYS: Start writing your essays for real now. Focus first on your Personal Statement. Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources. Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates. [Here’s my post about Making Peace with the Supplemental Essays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xdbil5/making_your_peace_with_the_supplemental_essays/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). How many [“Why College” Essays](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14mevoYJi-mzDBiDOCqh4Sotiu_Bjz5mOpy7_Hc3zhQ0/edit?usp=sharing) do you have? When's the first one due? Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the Extracurricular Essays. Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1. Use an app organizer for this.\n\nINTERVIEWS: Be sure to check your email (and voicemail and trash and spam folders for interview invitations). Every school has a different method for signing up, so read their websites carefully. For some, you are automatically signed up when you apply. Others require you to sign up yourself or to apply by a certain deadline. In most cases, they are optional, and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity. I do suggest that you do them though if they are available to you — even if they’re optional and you’re nervous. Lean into your fear, admit it to them if you want, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go.

    "body": "Is this letter going to all students  or to only those who will be deferred ? \n\nContent of letter \n\nTomorrow, approximately 3,500 first-year students will be notified that they have been admitted to USC. However, the majority of applicants will be notified that their application was deferred to the Regular Decision round. This can raise many questions, and we’d like to help you sort through what it all means.  \n\n\nQ: I wasn’t admitted during the Early Action round. Does that mean I’m not going to be admitted to USC?  \nA: We plan to make 60% of our offers of admission in the Regular Decision round. Many incredible students will be admitted to USC in the Regular Decision process and will receive their admission decision in late March. Not being admitted at this point is not indicative of your likelihood of admission later. Your application is still very much under consideration.  \n\nQ: Why wasn’t I admitted EA?  \nA: The process of selecting our first group of admits was very competitive. Over 41,000 students applied by the Early Action deadline, and we will offer admission to about 3,500. We use both quantitative and qualitative factors in our review process and there is no formula for gaining admission to USC at any point in our process.\n\nQ: Should I send you my fall grades?  \nA: Yes!. Please submit your final fall grades if you or your counselor have not done so already. A mid-year transcript is the only item we will accept to continue our review of your application.\n\nQ: Can I submit new essays, resumes or letters of recommendation for you to consider in the Regular Decision process?\n\nA: No. In the interest of equity, we are not considering new application materials, nor will we accept revisions of previously submitted materials. The only information we need since you first applied is your mid-year transcript, if you haven’t submitted it already.\n\nLastly, please make sure to submit the EA Deferral Form in your applicant portal (see next question).\n\nQ: How can I show USC I am still interested in admission?\n\nA: In your applicant portal, you can submit the EA Deferral Form to tell us you would like to be considered in the Regular Decision round. This is the best and only way to indicate you are still interested in pursuing admission to USC.\n\nQ: Can I send you a Letter of Continued Interest?\n\nA: No. If you are still interested in being considered, submit the EA Deferral Form found in your portal.\n\nQ: Was I deferred because I didn’t submit a test score (or because of my test score)? Can I change my testing plan at this point? \nA: We take many things into consideration when deciding who to admit. We do not penalize students who choose to apply test-optional. Furthermore, given the nature of our holistic review, decisions are based on a combination of factors. At this stage in our review process, we cannot change your testing plan.  \n\nQ: When will I receive a final admission decision?  \nA: Regular Decision applicants will hear back from us by April 1st.\n\nQ: Am I still eligible for need-based financial aid?  \nA: Yes. Financial aid is need-based—not merit-based—and eligibility is separate from the merit scholarship process. If you are interested in receiving need-based aid, please apply as soon as possible by submitting the FAFSA and CSS Profile, if you have not done so already. You can learn more here.\n\nQ: Will my admission decision be impacted if I choose to apply for need-based financial aid? \n\nA: No! USC is need-blind, meaning we do not consider financial need when making admission decisions. In fact, admission counselors do not have access to your financial aid application. We encourage all eligible students to apply for financial aid.  \n\nQ: Are there any merit scholarships available to students who aren’t admitted Early Action?  \nA: There aren’t any available from the Office of Admission (aside from the National Merit Scholarship noted above), but there are some still available through other USC organizations. Many have specific eligibility conditions and ask for a separate application, so be sure you are on top of those requirements and deadlines. These scholarships tend to have a smaller monetary value, but we know that every bit counts.\n\n** Note that departments requiring a portfolio or audition had a December 1st Regular Decision deadline, and handle scholarships separately. **\n\nPlease review the list of scholarships for more information.\n\nQ: How do I withdraw my application for admission to USC?  \nA: You can do this via the applicant portal.\n\nQ: I have more questions. Who can I talk to?   \nA: If you have any questions, or wish to email the Office of Admission, we invite you to visit askUSC. Applicants can also call the Admission Contact Center at (213) 740-1111.  And don’t forget to follow @USCAdmission on Instagram, X , YouTube, and the USC Admission Blog. We will post information and reminders, as well as answer questions, throughout the coming months.  \n\nWe wish you the best of luck with the application process! \n\nThis blog was written in partnership with the Office of Undergraduate Admission.\n\nUpdated on 1/16/25 by Leslie Escobedo – Assistant Director"

My view on church is if you like it, that’s great, just don’t tell me I’m going to hell because I’m not one of you.\n\nMe personally, my parents pushed the academic side and prestige of the school when selecting colleges to apply to.  I’m not my dad or mom so I don’t want to poo poo my nephews dreams but looking at some of those private school tuition made me wonder if he needs to refine his criteria.\n\nHe also mentioned he wanted to study theology or as he put it, I don’t want to study one religion but just religious stuff in general.  I was like oh ok cool, but in my mind I was thinking that’s a lot of money to just studying that topic.\n\nWe’re in Virginia but I’m just a little bit worried that in that he might be picking a study that might not have the best return based on the colleges he’s looking at.  I think one of the school he’s looking at is Messiah in Penn and it’s 50-60 a year.  \n\nEDIT:  My wife took him to an open house for Messiah College and while he sat in on one of their biblical studies class, he met a professor that taught a photography class and he ended up talking to him for an hour.  My wife did ask him“If you major in biblical studies then what’s the end game at the moment?”  He chuckled a little bit, kinda shrugged and said I dunno.  I’m just a sophomore he said. When I asked why don’t you major in photography/media/digital media my wife said Messiah didn’t offer that major.  So now I’m thinking why doesn’t he major in some type of media while attending church/religious group at school thereby keeping close to his faith if it happens to not be a religious school.  Just a thought."

Told me to just shotgun T20s. My grades are fine and my ecs, I hope, are pretty good, but I probably won't get into a T20, unfortunately. He's been mentioning Ivies since I was 8 (selected Princeton for me and Brown for my sister?? When we were 8 and 6??) so basically he's been pushing for this for 9 years. At this point our relationship has become so eroded because of this that I'm planning on cutting off ties eventually after studies. I don't know if I'm just weak hearted but I cry every meeting I have with my counselor with my dad present. It's so exhausting and honestly I would love to go UMass Amherst because I actually like my safety schools.\n\nI also think my dad doesn't really know how college admissions work these days because he told me to quit my ecs and just get a 4.00 GPA, study for SAT, and write a good essay. I'm just so tired (I do IB diploma, kms) and I want to quit everything. My whole U.S. side of the family are expecting me to get into a T20 because of how many freaking legacies they have and I don't want to disappoint them but at the same time I have all this unconscious hate towards their expectations. This got bad enough that it impacted my grades. I went from an A+ to a C to an F in math for two tests, and now every day I think about those two grade on my transcript. I probably can't get into any of my reaches now.\n\nMaybe this sounds like I'm whining, and maybe I am-- I know how privileged and fortunate I am to even have the means of applying and parents funding my education. I'm not discounting my privilege, but this has just been weighing on my mind for the whole of junior year so far and I feel terrible and I feel like my motivation has dropped.\n\nEdit: Thank you for everyone's comments and supportive words, I feel a little better now. My counselor has told my dad all this information before and I have already in the past tried to explain to him that acceptances rates are getting lower so I honestly consider him a lost cause at this point. I do agree he wants the best for me but I would like it if he didn't show it like this. Also, got a DM from someone 'selling ECs', whatever that means. "

Read more about their approach here:  https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/holistic-review/.  \n\nYour odds of admission can be significantly impacted by your choice of major.  Most UW students are admitted to the university and enter their major *after* enrolling.  The most selective and competitive majors admit freshmen directly. \n See more here:  https://admit.washington.edu/apply/admission-to-majors/\n\n#Essays\n\nIt's definitely worth checking out this page with their writing tips:  https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/how-to-apply/writing-section/.  In particular, here's a few things to note:\n\n1.  You have to copy your Common App personal statement into their \"Writing\" section as a supplemental essay - they will not see it in the Common App Personal Statement section.  \n\n2.  Their Writing section does not support italics, double spacing, or some other formatting.  Your essays here will be rendered as plain text.  That's usually not a problem and does not require adjustment, but if you have any words or phrases where italics were important, you can use quotation marks or capital letters where appropriate.\n\n3.  They tend to like a more polished and \"professional\" approach compared to other colleges.  You should still be personal with the insights you're sharing, but you may want to consider modifying some phrasing to make it less casual in tone.  UW also more heavily considers grammar/syntax than other colleges and highly recommends editing and proofreading.\n\n4.  UW takes a stronger stance on the use of AI than some other colleges.  For example, [Georgia Tech considers ChatGPT to be similar to a free consultant/editor when used to critique writing](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2023/07/27/seniors-can-we-chatgpt/) (obviously, they don't allow you to claim its work as your own).  But UW says, *\"All writing in the application, including your essay/personal statement and short responses, must be your own work.  Do not use another writer’s work and do not use artificial intelligence software (ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) to assist or write your statement.\"*  As such, I do not recommend using AI in any capacity for your UW application.\n\n#Ask Me Anything\n\nCurious how to enhance your chances of admission to UW?

    "body": "Wow, this is exciting!  You just got the glossy mailer inviting you to apply to a *very prestigious* summer camp!  And it will be held at an Ivy!  With real, live Ivy ^(affiliated) professors teaching it!  Surely if you can somehow scrape together the low five figures they're asking for, this will all but cement your admission to that same school or other T20s come senior year...right?\n\nThe no-longer-secret truth about these programs is that they won't really help your application to a top 20 college.  And that's good news for most of us.  Quite often, the selection criteria for these programs is primarily (or even totally) driven by your ability to pay for them - I've taken to calling them **\"Summer Paygrams.\"**  They admit the vast majority of applicants, and do not typically offer opportunities and experiences that admissions offices will regard as distinctive or compelling.  It's quite possible for your parents to sign you up for one of these, and for you to go through the motions doing the bare minimum as a warm body in the room.  There may be no initiative, leadership, or even effort or engagement on your part.  And for some students, that's part of the draw - they get something they think looks good on their resume without much work or thoughtful planning, and it's a lot easier than blazing your own trail.  At the end of the day, there's very little impact to your college application, which is in direct contradiction to the biggest reason I've seen students and parents interested in these.  If you're a very strong applicant to top colleges, then attending a summer paygram probably won't hold you back.  If you're not a strong applicant, a summer paygram probably won't make you into one.\n\n#Pros and Cons of Summer Paygrams\n\n**Pros**\n- It's all planned for you.  So you don't have a litany of decisions to make or accountabilities to hold yourself to.  You can relax and enjoy the structured program.\n- Exploration.  You'll get a chance to see a college campus, dive into some classes and activities related to the topic/theme of the camp, and meet some interesting people.\n- It's better than bingeing Netflix or playing video games in your mom's basement all summer.\n\n**Cons**\n- It's all planned for you.  And admissions officers know that you didn't really achieve much - you mostly just showed up. \n- Opportunity cost.  You often can't take on as many other opportunities with your summer, so you need to think carefully about whether this is on your list of things you really want to do.\n- Financial cost. Many of these are crazy expensive - I've seen some over $20K+.\n\n#The Difference Between Quality Programs And Cash-Grab Paygrams\n\n>*\"How do I find the good summer programs that are actually worthwhile and will actually help make my college applications stronger?*\n\nAt the bottom of this post, I've listed out many of the best summer programs and very high quality options.  I have a similar set of criteria for evaluating programs as MIT does, and these are a good way to assess any program's value, especially from a college admissions perspective.  There are many excellent programs that will not manage to fully meet all of these factors.  But these are the best criteria for assessing quality and value.   The best ones are:\n\n- **Free** - The best programs are free or offer generous need-based financial aid.  There is a very nearly inverse relationship between the cost of a program and the value it brings to your college application.  Many of the best programs will even offer stipends to cover incidental expenses.  Note that a program does not *have* to be free to be high quality, but if an expensive program doesn't offer need-based aid, that's usually a strong indication that it's a paygram.\n\n- **Selective** - Programs admitting more than 80% of their applicants tend to be significantly less valuable that those with admit rates below 20%.  These rates are not often published, but many programs will have some indication of selectivity, or they will have limiting eligibility requirements.\n\n- **Intellectually Compelling** - You should learn meaningful content, find your curiosity or inquisitiveness encouraged, and be given opportunities to explore material at a deeper level. \n\n- **Educationally Rigorous** - You should be challenged and held accountable for being fully engaged.  The best programs will mirror the rigor of undergraduate study.\n\n- **Community Driven** - They should intentionally foster a great community of like-minded peers and a student cohort that is interesting and inclusive.  Both the students and faculty should support the culture of learning & rigor, emphasis on interpersonal connection, community vibe, and communal enjoyment of sharing passion and geeking out over the subject together.  There should be opportunities to get to know other students, develop relationships, and continue discussions.  At the best programs, attendees tend to stay in touch afterward and even reconnect in college.\n\n- **Enriching** - You should walk away with a profound sense that the experience was worthwhile and that it deepened your interest and understanding of the subject matter.\n\n- **Fun** - This is your life, and you only get one.  You don't want to waste a summer slogging through something you hate or killing off any spark of interest in the topics or subjects you're exploring.  Good programs find ways to make the experience enjoyable, and most students are sad when it's over.\n\nIf you want to spot the worst programs and avoid borderline scams or costly mistakes, consider the opposite qualities to those listed above.  Programs which check too many off this list are probably not worthwhile:\n\n- **Expensive** - Little to no financial aid is offered, and the price tag is in the high four to low five figures.  Paygrams.\n\n- **Open Enrollment** - Many expensive paygrams will admit 80% or more of their applicants with some admitting anyone willing to pay.  This means enrolling some students who are unmotivated or unqualified. \n\n- **Intellectually Bland** - There are few if any opportunities for deeper engagement with the material and subject matter.  They simply push through the planned syllabus. \n\n- **Educationally Light** - The program and content are clearly catering to the lowest common denominator of admitted student, and that's not a high bar to clear.  Little to no material is presented at the college level and is instead simple and introductory.  Students' main responsibility is to show up rather than to demonstrate mastery, think critically, or apply the knowledge and skills they're learning.\n\n- **Siloed or Individualistic** - There is little community or culture to speak of.  Most students were sent by their parents and are just there to check the boxes.  Faculty are there to get through it and collect their paycheck. Opportunities for personal connection or continued discussions are limited or performative.\n\n-**Inert** - The goal is completion of the program, not a richer understanding of the subject, an engaging experience, or an enhanced skill set.\n\n- **Boring or Tedious** - The classes are dry and plodding.  Assigned exercises are geared toward regurgitating information rather than applying it in creative or innovative ways.  When the paygram finally ends, both the students and faculty are relieved.\n\n#FAQ\n\n>**How many selective summer programs should I apply to?**\n\nThis depends on how much time you have available, how competitive your application is, and how determined you are to land a spot at a good program.  Most of my strongest and most determined students apply to 8-15 programs, partially because most of the essays are substantially the same.  It also depends on how many programs you actually find interesting.\n\n>**Everyone knows these \"paygrams\" are a terrible value, especially for college admissions.  Why are you wasting time talking about this?**\n\nFirst, while it's no longer a secret, there are still hundreds of people who don't know or find out too late.  Below are some actual things parents have said to me during consultations:\n\n- \"Our daughter was admitted to a really great program this summer at Harvard, so obviously that's going to really boost her chances at Ivies.\"\n\n- \"This program sounds amazing, but not quite affordable - I just wanted your thoughts on whether it's worth financing it with a loan?\"\n\nSecond, the list of programs below will introduce many high quality options that may not be on most students' radar.  Check it out.\n\n>**\"Are the best and most selective summer programs worth applying for?  Will they actually strengthen my college application?  It seems like a lot of work.\"**\n\nThe best summer programs are absolutely worth it both because of the experience and opportunities and because top colleges recognize their value, rigor, selectivity, and distinction. There's a bit of chicken-and-egg to this because incredible students are more likely to get into top summer programs and also more likely to get into top colleges.  But the following examples of students I worked with aren't coincidental:\n\n1.  A student I worked with last year who attended SSP got into Harvard, 5 UCs (including UCLA & UC Berkeley, with Regents at 3 of them), and was offered a full ride from USC.  Her only rejection was Stanford.\n\n2.  One of our students this year who attended SSP is a finalist for multiple full ride scholarships and just got a likely letter (call) from Yale.\n\n3.  The last student we worked with who attended RSI was admitted to nine T20 colleges.\n\n4.  A few years ago we worked with a student who attended a highly selective medical research program.  Despite not being in the traditional \"top tier\" of applicants, they were admitted ED to Northwestern.\n\n5.  Our last student who attended BeaverWorks was admitted to 3 Ivies and 7 T20s.\n\n6.  Another way to consider this - every student we've ever worked with who attended one of the programs listed below was admitted to one or more T20s.  That doesn't mean these are guarantees of admissions success, but it's not nothing.\n\n>**\"HELP!  I attended or am about to attend a paygram!  How can I make it worthwhile?\"**\n\nMany paygrams are fine for what they are - they just aren't going to materially improve your college application.  Some give you real college-level coursework or have elements that fall on both sides of the list of criteria I shared above.  If you're considering a paygram, the real question is whether you value the program itself and what you'll learn there enough, and whether you'll make the most of it.  But if all you're looking for is a way to boost your college applications, there are other things that would move the needle more.\n\nYou should consider these the way colleges will consider them, namely, that the impact and depth of engagement is what matters, not the fancy-sounding name brand or the fact that you were a warm body in a chair at a summer program for a few weeks.  Even an outstanding and selective program won't move the needle much if you aren't able to demonstrate that you learned, explored, achieved, created, etc.  And even the lesser programs could still be quite worthwhile if you really apply yourself and make an impact. \n\nSo for example, if your college application lists that you went to a quality program like MIT MITES, but doesn't share any details about what you learned, accomplished, or valued, it's not going to really change their assessment of you all that much.  But on the other hand, if you go to a low-profile, for-profit, open-enrollment (non-selective) coding camp and learn Ruby on Rails, BUT then use it to build a complex and impactful mobile app for an organization you're involved in, that would be a significant accomplishment.  It would show that you have a strong work ethic, take initiative, and own your education, using your skills to make a difference.  It would show that you can take responsibility, lead practically, learn meaningful things, and apply them.  As I've said before, the impact is what matters, not the hours, brand name, \"impressiveness,\" or presentation. \n\nAs it happens, the best, most selective, and highest quality summer programs are usually the ones that also provide the best opportunities for impact.  Many of the for-profit ones are more about going through the motions, checking boxes, and looking impressive than they are about actual impact.  No matter what kind of program you attend, I think the best things to do are:\n\n**1.  Approach it intentionally.**  Don't view this as merely an opportunity to get the \"Ivy+ brand\" listed on your resume.  Don't just show up and go through the motions.  Instead, be purposeful, engaged, and focused.\n\n**2.  Think about what you want out of the program, then look for opportunities for that.**  Are you looking to network with other students or profs?  Build a particular skill set?  Learn and explore more deeply into a particular topic? \n\n**3.  Find a way to independently apply something you did or learned in the program.**  Like the example I mentioned before, if you can take something you learned and then apply it on your own in a different setting or context, that's fantastic and would show that you truly got value out of the program and made the most of it.  You might not be able to say for sure what this would be or what it would look like beforehand.  But you should ask yourself, \"after I finish this program, what are the next steps?  Where do I go from here?  How do I build on this momentum?\"\n\n**4.  Worry less about how you might present or \"spin\" something, and more about what you really want to do.**  If you're pursuing things you love because you love them, then you don't need to spin that.  You can just be honest about who you are, what you love, and what you want to pursue.\n\nTo give you an example of why the above are important, top colleges obviously want students who are high-achieving academically and have demonstrated that they are fully capable.  BUT they despise the idea of pursuing strong grades or academic accolades as a rubber stamp of approval.  They are repulsed by the idea of a student doing something just because it will look good on a college application.  They want intellectual vitality - a persistent curiosity, engagement, and pursuit of topics and fields you love, not because you think they're impressive or anything, but simply because you love them.  They want sincere passion, deep interest, and exploration & learning for its own sake.\n\n#The Best Summer Programs\n\nBelow is my list of programs which, in my opinion, are high quality and have a lot to offer, especially from a college admissions perspective.  To varying degrees, they perform well against most or all of the criteria I listed above.  Check them out and put together your own list of the ones that are the most interesting to you.  There is no order to these, and since these programs are subject to change each year, there may be some that are no longer offered or have changed in material ways.

Many of them are fantastic, but there may be a few in these lists that lean into the category of expensive, non-selective, go-thru-the-motions camps.  So use these lists to find the ones you're interested in, then do more research on those to determine if they meet the criteria outlined above (enriching, fun, selective, intellectually compelling, educationally rigorous, community driven, and are either free or offer generous need-based financial aid).\n\n•\tNational Conference of Governor's Schools Summer Programs:  https://www.ncogs.us/programs.html.  These are listed by state. \n\n•\tQuestBridge Summer Programs - These summer programs have partnered with QuestBridge to provide full funding for QuestBridge College Prep Scholars.  If you're eligible for QuestBridge (strong academics, <$65K household income, minimal assets), I HIGHLY recommend checking this out.  If you are not eligible for QuestBridge, it's still worth checking out their list of partner programs because many are fantastic.   https://www.questbridge.org/apply-to-college/programs/college-prep-scholars-program/scholarships-and-awards/summer-programs\n\n•\tMIT's list of year-round STEM programs & opportunities:  https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/stem/\n\n•\tDavidson Institute list of gifted summer programs:  Day Camps.  https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/gifted-summer-programs-day-camps/\n\n•\tDavidson Institute list of gifted summer programs:  Residential Programs.  https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/gifted-summer-programs-residential/\n\n•\tDavidson Institute list of gifted summer programs, sorted by topics of interest:  https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/gifted-summer-programs-listed-by-topics-of-interest/\n\n#A Final Test\n\nOne final way to evaluate whether a program is high quality and \"worth it\" or not is to swap out the brand affiliation.  Pretend the program is being offered by a less prestigious college, e.g. a directional state school, rather than a T20.  If Middle Tennessee State offered you a pre-college summer program for $15K, would that look as alluring as the exact same program offered by an Ivy?  Highly selective admissions offices **will not** consider where a program was held or what affiliations/brands it has.  They're evaluating these on the basis of what the actual experience is like and what they can learn about YOU, the applicant, from your experience.  Two great examples of this - among the very best and most impactful summer programs you can do are the Anson Clark Scholars Program and the Simons Summer Research Program, which are held at Texas Tech and Stony Brook.  Those are great colleges, but not especially prestigious.  But it wouldn't matter whether those programs were held at Harvard or your local community college because they fully meet all the criteria I listed above.  By the same token, a go-through-the-motions paygram at a T20 won't hold much weight no matter where it's held or who is sponsoring it because it fails all or nearly all of the criteria.\n\n#TL;DR\n\nMost pre-college summer programs aren't very valuable for college admissions, despite their prestigious locations or high price tags.  Check out my criteria and list of quality programs to make the most of your time and money. \n\nIf you think I missed something, got something wrong, or just have questions, feel free to let me know in the comments or reach out on my website at www.bettercollegeapps.com.  Stay tuned for my next post on how to craft a strong application for truly selective summer programs."

    "body": "After attending a year of college and talking to some of my peers who came from wealthier families, I am beginning to realize how unfair of a business college admissions truly is.\n\nIn my high school we had a very socioeconomically diverse graduating class, with a small portion of kids living in apartments and who were going to school just to get free lunch, the bulk majority of kids being middle class, while a much much smaller portion of the student body being made up of those whose parents would drive a Rolls-Royce or equivalent and lived in a huge house.\n\nI never thought about how much this economic divide would impact college admissions but after a conversation with my closest college peers I found out that many had used third-party consulting services offering tips, some even since 6th grade.\n\nThe way I think of it now is that once you reach a certain high school GPA/Leadership/other statistic threshold, you are on the same threshold level as all other \"seriously viable\" applicants to those selective colleges and the only way to stand out at this point is through your essay/interview. There was genuinely no way for us normies to get on the same essay/interview optimization level as the wealthy kids who paid for those consulting services.\n\nWhile us normies were rushing to schedule 15 minute one on one sessions with our high school's poor and overworked college counselor who was managing a class of 400 students, the rich kids were probably (I say probably because none of my high school peers talk about whether they used these services but I would assume if you own a $500,000 house, $25,000 is chump change for consulting) paying for consulting services getting access to one on one time with a former admissions officer at a top tier college for who knows how much time.\n\nNow that I look back upon it, it definitely seems that all things being equal, the kids who were pulling up to high school in a bmw were significantly more likely to get into a selective school as compared to those who were riding the bus to school (all other statistics being equal, ie reaching the point of being a seriously viable given the average candidate statistics at each college).\n\nI've been told that life is not fair by many of my high school peers, but it's hard to accept this because of how much more I prioritize the quality of my education and how much pressure I put on my future self to support my parents when they grow older and maybe even a family as compared to some of my peers who were born into wealth. \n\nTo make matters even worse, I keep hearing about how these selective colleges are \"target schools\" for many firms and that in order to get an internship/job through a regular flagship public college you need network, nepotism, or to spam LinkedIn easy apply like a dog and get lucky.\n\nNow that I am informed of how prevalent college consulting is, I am only left to wonder what percent of the private high school students had access to these.\n\nIts truly unfair how these consulting companies make it for other students who have good grades, athletic rankings, leadership and extracurriculars but don't have the money to \"optimize\" the vocabulary of their essay or spend money on private ACT tutoring. \n\nFurthermore I think these companies would get more ambitious junior employees by placing less emphasis on the prestigious universities and hiring more people from the top of their class in public universities. For these students, I feel as though ambition or hard work isn’t the limiting factor, it’s money, prestigie, and connections.  "

    "body": "Last year around this time, I received my last post-II decision, an R from my in-state school. I was distraught and frankly, felt like I was a failure for having to reapply the following cycle (side note: you are NOT a failure for reapplying). I was in an inconsolable place, but found some solace after reading u/pumpkpie_chem's love letter reddit post. My hope is to also encourage other fellow reapplicants out there that the journey doesn't end, and it will be okay in the end. (I'm writing this on a whim, so hopefully it's not too disorganized.)\n\nLast cycle, I was on my third gap year and felt that I had done everything in my power to prepare for a strong application. Some more info: ORM, 510-515 MCAT, 3.7 GPA, 4th Q Casper (low preview like 3?), some service-heavy activities, 3000 hrs of research, and longitudinal experiences (you can message me for more details). I applied to almost 50 MD schools (latest complete mid Aug), and threw a few DO in as well, albeit I applied 'late' for DO (complete mid/late Oct). I had done some prior research on making a balanced school list using MSAR, had collected various LORs from my mentors/professors who I felt close with, and delved deep into crafting a PS that I felt was representative of me. Looking back, I did try to have a quick turnaround for secondaries, but ended up submitting many 3-4 weeks afterwards and even later than that due to a family vacation that was veryyy ill-timed. In the end, I received 2 II's: one from my in-state flagship in early September, and another top 20 CA school in December. I was ecstatic for them, but the latter ended in a WL with low hopes of getting off (iykyk which school), and the former a formal R, after being ghosted for 8 months... Each passing day in May felt like torment to me—refreshing SDN every hour, contemplating what further I could do to possibly get off the WL, and basically spiraling. For those who are on WLs, I'm sure you can relate. The unknown felt terrifying.\n\nIn the end, I realized I had to cut my losses for that WL (I'm all or nothing, and it was wiser to redirect my emotional energy fretting into crafting a better reapplication). I decided to go all in to reapply one last time, since AMCAS was open to submit soon. I would say I like to plan for worst-case scenarios... So earlier that February, I had already decided to transition out of my MA role into clinical research, just in case I needed to reapply (you don't have to change roles, but medical schools do generally like to see applicant growth and I felt this was the right choice for me). I did some serious reflection in therapy to address WHY I felt this upset over reapplying, sought advice online, as well as considered whether my application had any unknown red flags that I hadn't considered. I realized that I felt deep shame for having to reapply, because I felt I was \"behind\" some unspoken timeline and failed myself/others. I'd already pushed back my gap years from 1 > 2 due to COVID and health issues, 2 > 3 due to MCAT struggles, and now it would've been 4 gap years (2 planned, and 2 unplanned). I felt even worse when I considered that my classmates from my alma mater (tier 1 school) all seemed to have successful cycles, and many were already even graduating soon! I wanted to crawl into my own shell when I realized I ALSO had to ask my professors to update my LOR, and that I'd have to explain that I'm reapplying. Tbh, that realization felt the worse for me, because I felt that I'd let my mentors down as well.\n\nEventually, I got over the self-pity and decided that I could only move forward; perhaps this would be a redirection for me. I attended some applicant feedback sessions (from my state school), which was helpful in confirming that I didn't have any red flags, but that I probably just didn't \"stand out\" enough. I was VERY torn whether I needed to make major changes to my reapplication since I'd heard that as standard advice, but I'm also very glad I trusted my gut. I made minimal changes to my reapplication, because I believed that it was a matter of FRAMING and presenting myself, and not about the content of my activities or stats. At the core, my \"why medicine\" hadn't changed and I felt it disingenuous to myself to *completely* revamp my application.\n\nSo this cycle, I only changed my healthcare job and my essays (I also applied to 5-10 more schools than last cycle). I worked extremely hard to re-package myself in a way that I felt showed growth, as well as sincere passion and commitment for EACH medical school. These two efforts made a HUGE difference imo. Off the bat, I received 5 MD II's (a couple low tier, one mid-tier, and the others T30) and 4 DO's, with A's to both (though 4/5 of my MD ones ended in WLs, which I withdrew from). I am very grateful that the A I received is actually really close to home for me. When I was younger (not that I'm old), I really wanted to spread my wings far and live further away from family (I did this is undergrad and it wasn't what I imagined lol). But as I've grown, I realized that it's ideal for me personally to be near a support system. Here are some takeaways I've learned as a reapplicant (please take it with a grain of salt, as it's n=1 sample size):\n\n1. MISSION FIT MATTERS. I realized too late that schools genuinely really care to select for the applicant they feel is the \"right fit\" for them. They're usually split between \"research heavy\" and \"service heavy\" schools. My first cycle (2023-24), I had thought I could have my cake and eat it too (I had what I believed to be a lot of research and service), so I didn't intentionally try to cater to either. I tried to market myself as well rounded, and in the end appeared lackluster (well-rounded is good, but be careful with overly appealing to every school). This cycle, I reflected more deeply what my strengths were, and focused on schools that were service-oriented as they aligned more with my values and person. I made it extremely clear in my writing my goals/vision to continue service-related work as a med student and future physician.\n2. ESSAYS are so under-rated. People like to say that you can't have a truly bad or good essay, and the majority are just okay. While that may be true, please don't discredit them. Do NOT plug and chug a template into chatGPT or deepseek and copy-paste into each secondary. I know applying to a broad school list makes it daunting to write everything uniquely, but it will help if you seriously take the TIME to do research about each school, present genuine reasons for WHY you truly like x school, and write from your heart. I was guilty of trying to speedrun essays in my first cycle, and I think that truly hurt my application.\n   1. Schools can tell when you do not care for their mission or unique offerings, and it's more obvious than you'd expect to be able to tell from an applicant's writing tone if they've done their due diligence or not. Some things I did differently included signing up for info sessions and attending them (schools often go into way more detail about their curriculum and mission etc during these), interacting/asking Q's with current students, attending any events from their social media posts, etc. These can help you be more genuine/specific about what specifically you're excited about for x school. Let's be real, many schools have an integrated or flipped classroom curriculum, with distinction tracks, and study abroad programs... As an applicant, you can definitely dig even deeper to find something that resonates with you for why you're PERSONALLY excited to attend x school.\n   2. Additionally, I used flowery language my first cycle. Please don't do that unless you think you can do it well; I imagine adcoms after reading their 10,000th essay would be exhausted from the same overly-sycophantic style of writing. I decided to write sincerely and more straightforward this cycle. I tried to be more clear with my writing and I think it helped greatly (idk if this applies to others, but I do know I struggle with being roundabout).\n3. Craft a good school list (make sure to have more target schools than reaches). There are many resources out there to help with that. An applicant pitfall is applying to too many schools that have low-yield (ex. Georgetown, Drexel), in-state heavy preference (ex. many state schools heavily prefer in state people, most notorious is UW since they usually require WWAMI), service heavy schools without the hours to back it up (ex. Rush, Loyola), or just having too many top tier schools (ex. HYP). I found MSAR to be helpful in seeing the ratio of OOS:IS, applicant and matriculant GPA and MCAT ranges. Be careful applying to too many that your stats are in the lowest or out-of-range percentile (ofc you can apply, but be wary that there's a reason schools have a range and most successful matriculants generally do fall within that range). Additionally, there are a few Jesuit schools (Georgetown, Loyola, SLU, Creighton), so be aware that they often focus on person-centered care/cura personalis. \n   1. I've noticed that many schools tout they're open to OOS, but be wary that more often than not, many schools do genuinely care more for applicants who have local ties or are connected somehow to them. For ex, I believe partly why I received a good midwest MD II was I had some minimal ties to the area. At the end of the day, med schools like to retain their med graduates in the area, so there's reason for them to filter applicants partially based on their likelihood to stay and serve the locale.\n4. PS: I didn't change much for my personal statement this time around, because I believed that my core reason for pursuing medicine hadn't changed. I had already gone through 4-5 iterations of edits last cycle, so I only made minimal edits this reapplication cycle (like 1-2 sentences changed). This may not be true for everyone, so I encourage reapplicants to dig deeper for possible ways to improve! I just wanted to give an example to others that every situation is different.\n5. LORs can be slightly dated. I actually attempted to reach out to all my advisors and was ghosted by my undergrad PI (of 3.5 years) as well as my attending... It was very awkward and I was extremely worried that having a 1-2 year old LOR would hurt my chances. I submitted anyway (with some updated LORs and a couple old ones), and it seems to have went okay! I think realistically, every applicant will have some strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay not to be neurotic over making everything \"perfect.\"\n6. Be wary of \"new\" vs. old reapplied schools! I know people before me have had great luck with reapplying to the SAME schools they did their first cycle as schools often welcome reapplicants. However, I was worried so this time around, I was careful to split about 50/50 with my school list (half old schools, half new schools) in case I would somehow be \"penalized\" for reapplying. Actually, I'm really glad I did this because that old adage has not been the case for me sadly... Most of my II's were actually from \"new\" ones that I hadn't applied to previously. Only one low tier MD interviewed me this cycle that I'd applied to last year. The school I'm attending was a new one I added last minute lol. Additionally, I believe that some schools interview applicants on the cusp sometimes with minimal/no intention of giving them an A, barring extreme circumstances. This is only my opinion, but I interviewed at a few top 20 schools with lower stats as an ORM, and was placed on all WLs. I think schools may give you a chance based on your life story or mission fit, but do be careful overextending hope on getting off certain WLs (like be cautiously hopeful). \n\n7. Make sure your story is cohesive. It should make sense to adcoms how one activity/life event has led you to another, and ultimately to medicine. Your AMCAS activities, PS, and secondaries should clarify WHY medicine, but also prove to adcoms that you are certain this path is for you. They want to know you've done your due diligence to ascertain what this path entails (as it's long, often gruelsome work, and is a heavy investment), as well as ensure you are ready for the rigors of school and standardized testing. Your job as an applicant is to somehow prove/show them that you know what you're getting yourself into.\n8. IIs. Usually they're MMI or traditional. Interestingly, in my last cycle, my two IIs were MMI-based. And during my post-interview feedback, the director of admissions noted that ONE of my stations didn't quite like my answer for MMI :( I was surprised since the common saying is that interviewers just want to hear your reasoning and there's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer. After interviewing 10+ schools cumulatively, I will say that I've noticed that while that can be true, interviewers are still human and they may resonate more or less with certain answers you have.. I previously read the MMI book by Desai and it was helpful for me, however I can't say much about it since this cycle, my As were all from traditional interviews lol... It's possible that I just really suck at MMI or it's a fluke, but regardless, I highly encourage (re)applicants to be cautious about how you portray your answers and I think practice for MMI can help. I think as a non-trad, my strength was traditional interviews since I'd already worked various jobs prior and am very familiar with how to do well in it. For traditional interviews, be human; it's okay to make jokes or even be awkward! Adcoms know it's stressful so there's no need to overly rehearse your answers (be sure to know why med, why doctor, tell me about yourself, why this school).\n\nI'm sure there's more stuff but these are all I can think of now. If this can help one person, I will feel it was more than worth! Again, these are my own thoughts so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nI sometimes get bummed that it took me more years than my peers (which is more of a me issue that I want to address in therapy lol), however I do truly believe that things fall into place for a reason. If I had gotten in last cycle, I would've been ill-prepared because I was recovering from an intensive surgery and couldn't physically move/be a student. I've recovered since then and feel I've come a long way in this last year (I'm grateful for the added year I had to spend with family and friends as well, and explore my early to mid 20s). Have faith in yourself, and know that it's not over until it's truly over. As one mentor once said to me, \"it's a long becoming process.\" \n\nMy DM's are open and I'll try my best to answer any questions :) Good luck future applicants and reapplicants! I believe you can do this <3 "

    "body": "I was left to struggle through the college admissions process in my own so this post is for those need it!\n\n1). SAT OR ACT: personally I’d advise you to start testing your sophomore year to see which test you align with more, but also you do need to start testing early so that you can already have a good score. I favor the SAT it’s easier especially financially as there are free resources like khan academy, blue book, and also YouTube videos(I score a 1410 and took it twice bc I waited till my senior year which was a bad idea.\n\n2) Passion Project/Research/ECs: please please please only do things that you are actually interested in and want to build towards. I promise you doing a bunch of clubs that have nothing to do with your college major do not look good. Clubs like key, beta, etc. where the vast majority of applicants are involved are good but can be time wasters. Find a couple of things you are interested in and build on those by joining clubs or doing research(if possible).\n\n3) if you want to go to a school actually research it. T20s and Ivies are random with who they select but you can definitely model your resume after those who have been admitted. Do not just go to a school because of the name or even apply(application fees are way too high) understand what that school has to offer for your interest. This means student life, financial aid, as well as the environment. Personally I like brown but I do not want to live in Rhode Island, environment matters as well.\n\n4) Summer programs: DO THEM PLEASE. I was from a very small town and then for the last two years of high school I have been attending a Stem Boarding school in my state. And everyone would discuss their summer programs, and I did not know they existed. Summer programs are very important and show colleges how you go outside your bounds to pursue your interest. I personally did TASS don’t ask me how I got in I don’t know.\n\n5) If you can get a college admissions counselor OR try to educate yourself through other media resources. I wish I had an admissions counselor especially having a parent who is uninvolved in the college process.\n\n6) I do not care if you have to fake it BUILD RELATIONSHIPS. You need to have at least two teachers who adore you because when the time rolls around for those letters of recommendation it can be what gets you accepted or denied.\n\nThis is a short list and just how I feel or would have wanted to know"

    "body": "My whole life, I’ve been obsessed with college, obsessed with prestige, trying to find something external to prove to myself that I was good enough—probably.\n\nI became an admissions prophet; people at my high school came to me for help. I was obsessed with this subreddit and posted countdowns to my “hopeful” UChicago ED acceptance. Even when I was in middle school, I was watching those college reaction videos on YouTube. To some extent, a whole portion of my life has been taken up by thinking about doing the very thing I am doing now—and that thing looks a little different than I thought it would.\n\nI will say something a bit dramatic, but assuming this subreddit hasn’t changed, I know it will hit home for some of you—which is that I seriously told my mom before the UChi ED decisions came out that if I got rejected, she should keep a close watch on me. That was my whole life. What was all the work in my life for if I didn’t get to do something with it? I was rejected, and then I held on to all my other prestigious decisions. I received rejection after rejection, and even when I got in somewhere that was “fine,” it didn’t feel **good enough** unless it was one of the top universities in the whole world. And I didn’t even apply to most of those!\n\nMaybe you guys have that fear too. What is all this work for if it amounts to *nothing?*\n\nAnd to that, I want to ask—who has made us think that our work amounts to nothing if we aren’t accepted into a T20 or even T10 university? The very prowess that allows us to apply to these schools in the first place is what will get us far—not just the schools themselves.\n\nAnd sure, I’d be an idiot to claim that titles don’t matter and prestige isn’t real, but my point here isn’t really about negating those things. It’s about the fact that there’s a lot more going on than JUST that. It’s easy to get pigeonholed by this process and in this process, and I still haven’t fixed my deep-seated prestige whore complex, but I’ve learned a lot about the fact that beating yourself up doesn’t help anyone.\n\nAnd maybe you transfer to your dream school. Maybe you apply there for grad school. There are so many maybes. But I remind myself, and I hope to remind you, that this process isn’t about where we end up going—it’s about the work we put in along the way! And look how much work you’ve all done! Your body and mind are literally changing, and during that, you’ve done something incredible—you’ve lived almost two decades! I still have high hopes and big dreams, and I still might base a little bit of my worth on where I end up going for grad school, but there is a lot more to all of this than titles and prestigious gatherings.\n\nAnd if it really comes down to it, you can apply to grad school a lot. And grad school is different—maybe your dream school doesn’t even have research that aligns with your goals. Maybe you don’t WANT to go to grad school. Maybe you get into your dream school for undergrad, and it’s not everything you’ve dreamed of, because no matter what, transitioning to adulthood is hard. No matter what, *living is hard.* It’s easy to get caught up in the “selectivity = better” mindset, but even some of the schools that I got into that had 20-40% acceptance rates weren’t good fits for me and would’ve made it harder for me to do what I’m doing now. \n\nI know it’s quite cliché at this point, but your acceptances and rejections don’t define you. It’s okay to feel them, it’s okay to celebrate, or—on the other hand—completely lose your mind, buy a cake from DQ that says “Fuck You, Chicago,” and cry and feel worthless. Let yourself feel those things. But remind yourself that *feeling worthless is not the same as being worthless.* I am proud of you for entering such a tough race in the first place. It is those who shit their pants at the end of the marathon who really went the hardest, even if they smell like shit. And I’d argue winning the race here isn’t an acceptance to your dream school—it’s growing up. It’s going through the process of trying to sell yourself to people who know nothing about you, it’s facing doubt about your very purpose—*and still remaining whole.*\n\nBecause trust me, *you are ALL whole.* A few fragments may splinter off, but you’ll still remain whole. I haven’t even been active on this subreddit for two years maybe because it hurt too much, and that feels dramatic. But time passes, you learn new things, you care about other things. You feel less alone when you see other people in the same boat as you. \n\nIt’s easy to forget just how much range there is in this process. What feels like a dream school to one person might be someone else’s backup—or even a place they get into and don’t attend. And the school you see as a safety might be the exact place someone else is desperate for. There’s room for everyone in this, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. Regardless of where you’re headed, or how you’re feeling right now—it’s okay. \n\nI’m at my 80% acceptance rate state school, and I wasn’t even planning to apply here because I told myself if I ended up here, all my work was for nothing. But it’s actually quite a good fit for me. In-state tuition is fantastic, and it happens to have really good research and programs for what I want to do. I’m making the most of it, and I’m given a lot of flexibility. I’m a triple major with dual degrees in engineering and arts & sciences. And even if I don’t have the “prestige” title that comes with being at an Ivy, I’m reminding myself why I wanted that prestige so much in the first place—I *LOVE* to learn. And for those of you that love to learn, you can do that pretty much anywhere.\n\nYour work has never been for nothing. *It’s been for something.* And that something—is *you, now.*"

She claims that a lot of people who get into Yale and either of these schools don’t go to Yale and that therefore means that STEM at Yale is inferior. She also claims that all this marketing (YES scholars, the Hahn Scholars program) is evidence of such because they need to have other ways to attract students.\n\nI can maybe understand her take for subjects such as engineering and computer science.

Is Yale that inferior in the STEM sector? Is the Yale program worth it?\n\n(As for financial aid, I got a full ride to Yale and Stanford.

    "body": "I applied to colleges in the last admissions cycle. Despite doing extensive research, I decided to get a personal college counselor to *really* improve my application.\n\n**In short, was $7k worth it? Not really.**\n\n# Results\n\nI applied for Mechanical Engineering everywhere.\n\nI applied to the top 4 UCs, all Ivies, and other top schools like Stanford, USC, UMich, etc.  \nIn the end, my best admission offers were UMich, Georgia Tech, and NYU. I ultimately chose Georgia Tech (before someone asks why -- it was the most affordable option).\n\n# My Experience\n\nHonestly, the private counseling helped me a to an extent. Specifically:\n\n* Common App Essay: My counselor helped me improve the \"narrative\" of my essay. Initially, it sounded very book-story-like, with little \"personality\" to it. But my counselor guided me in a direction that definitely improved the essay. This was the biggest help, and it basically ends here lol.\n* Activities: While my counselor suggested specific ways to present my activities, it wasn’t anything extraordinary. After reviewing them, he mostly liked what I already had. Resources like some of the threads here by admissions mom, app helper, scholar grade, etc. were really helpful, and I had already used their advice to write my activities effectively.\n* Supplemental Essays: Same here. I had already read some incredible posts on this sub and guides by [collegeessayguy.com](http://collegeessayguy.com), which helped me a lot. My counselor didn’t make any major changes.\n* Other queries: I had a few random doubts about parts of the Common App, and my counselor did answer them, but most of the answers were what I expected. Did it help me re-confirm things I was unsure about? For sure. But was it worth paying that much for it? Not at all.\n\nOverall, I would say if I had paid like $2k-$3k, then it probably would have been worth it. Common app essay was the biggest help. But for everything else, all free resources and threads here on A2C are already top notch.\n\nThere’s an app called CounselAI on the app store which helped me a bit too, especially with supplemental essays. It has a feature that suggests unique ideas specific to a college based on your background. It’s paid after a free trial, so I only used it for a month. But I think it’s worth it for $20, because the final essay review was pretty similar to what I got from my counselor.\n\n# My Advice\n\nONLY if you can afford to spend some extra money, you should get a private counselor. That is it.\n\nThey aren't useless, nor are they some beings with secret knowledge. The point I'm trying to make is that **A2C is the best counselor for EVERYONE.** If you have 2nd thoughts on getting a counselor, it means you can't afford it, so don't. You just need to put in some extra work and read all the threads, go through college essay guy's blogs, and use tools like notion/the app i mentioned/google docs etc to combine all of these learning together in your application.\n\nI’d like to add that I opted for private counseling during my senior year. I know that some counselors begin working with students as early as their sophomore or junior year, offering additional support such as selecting extracurricular activities or starting essays early. However, these services come with an even higher cost so again it boils down to IF you TRULY have extra money to afford it. Otherwise, everything is online."

Harvard was my dream school, and I got deferred -> waitlisted -> rejected. This was also made worse by the fact that I had a lot of pressure (definitely abusive levels of it) from family to get into that level of institution.\n\nAt the time, I really did feel like a huge opportunity was taken away from me — and to an extent, it definitely was (there’s no denying the benefit of going to prestigious universities, especially when considering career benefits). However, I still go to a T20 school for my major/concentration and, honestly, I’ve learned to love it here. \n\nI understand how big decisions seem right now, but I have two pieces of advice I would’ve benefitted from greatly if I heard them as a senior in high school.\n\n(1), it’s a huge blessing to be able to worry about what prestigious schools you hope to get into. Perspective is very difficult to build, but once you read the statistics on how many people go to 4 year colleges/how few of them go to your target or even safety schools, you’ll realize just how far ahead you already are. Of course we want the world, but it’s extremely important to remember we already have so much land to live on that the rest of the world is just extra. \n\n(2), college is completely what you make of it, and you can do amazing from whatever school you go to. I have a lot of friends here that are in similar and often better positions than my friends at Ivy/Target schools, and it’s completely because they wasted no time networking, practicing, studying, and growing socially. Personally, my internship for the summer is not only selective but a lot of my fellow interns are from the same schools I got rejected from! It all stems from how hard I’ve worked and how passionate I am about my field… never forget that you are the one in control of where you end up, and what college you go to in undergrad is genuinely so unimportant after you prove to yourself that you’re legit and can excel at anything you put your mind to. \n\nGood luck regardless!

Some details about my stats, ECs, background, and some details about the content of my writing are indicated on the image, but if you have any additional questions about anything don't hesitate to ask!\n\nHere is a rough 'Table of Contents' so you can get a sense of the contents of this post. Just some different areas of reflection + advice.\n\nPersonal Assessment of Application Strengths + Weaknesses\n\nHow I chose my Undergrad\n\nAP Credits\n\nCommunity College Courses\n\nTips for those still in school\n\nWriting + Interviewing Tips\n\nParents in Medicine\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n# Strengths/things I did well (aside from stats alone):\n\n* Primary clinical experience was meaningful, longitudinal, and relevant to my future interest in psychiatry. I feel that this helped me convey a convincing 'why medicine' in addition to my other experiences\n* I don't think my writing was necessarily strong in the sense of presenting a unique narrative. I think that my writing was well-organized, cohesive, and clear, which was helped by starting drafts early (winter before applying). I also made it a priority to focus on being authentic and vulnerable, being willing to disclose experiences with things like bullying and engaging in therapy, and also actually making sure I answered all aspects of the prompt\n* Demonstrated other non-clinical interests pretty clearly through longitudinal involvement in various teaching positions + music, both of which came up plenty in interviews\n   * Overall I believe having good variety of activities, as well as experience working with and interacting with others from different walks of life beyond just the college bubble (first gen HS students, patients near end of life, middle aged chorusmates) enriched my college experience while also strengthening my application \n* Submitted early, pre-wrote, applied broadly (not too top-heavy), and applied out of CA\n* Believe at least some of my LORs were moderately-to-very strong given longitudinal nature of relationship, had a chance to read two of them. Hard to say how these were tho lol\n* Both of my parents are physicians, but I think I did a good enough job of making it clear that I'm pursuing this for myself and not for them. The fact that I have any family in healthcare made up only half of a sentence in my personal statement. This did still provide some talking points as some interviewers did ask about how having physicians as parents has shaped my path. I made it clear that they never really pushed me to go into medicine but that I've had the privilege of having role models + some ideas about how to balance family-life with the demands of medicine.\n\n# Possible weaknesses / shortcomings\n\n(i.e. why I think I got WL'd at so many T20s lol)\n\nI feel that I may have come across as either a bit too tentative (not as mission-driven) as these schools would have liked. I did NOT bring any sort of \"elevator pitch\" to my interviews (e.g. \"I want to be a world-class physician educator at an academic center\" or \"I want to work on initiatives to bring greater mental health awareness to the general public\" or \"I want to help uncover the biological underpinnings of bipolar disorder)\n\n* Even though I have an interest in some of these things, I think at most schools I basically came across as:\n   * I have some interest in psychiatry\n   * I'm definitely want to work with students in some capacity, though not sure in what kind of setting\n   * Not 100% sure if I would prefer working with a particular population of patients, but definitely want to come back to California to be near family\n   * Otherwise I will figure the rest out as I progress through medical school, but am open to changing my mind\n* In other words, in trying to focus on authenticity, I feel that I probably came across as just a \"nice person, solid student, open and reflective\" without also coming off super sharply as \"visionary\" or \"changemaker,\" which made it harder to stand out, especially at the elite schools\n   * I felt like it would have felt disingenuous for me to try to force an elevator pitch, especially since I am honestly still trying to figure things out and am open to change\n* The reason I bring this up is because a cousin in-law who is a recent Harvard alumnus and ex-admissions committee member basically directly gave me this feedback when I did a mock with her before I interviewed with HMS. She told me that when an interviewer asks you \"tell me about yourself,\" they are looking for your elevator pitch/mission, what makes you tick etc.\n   * I still don't fully agree with this approach in interviews (at least for the \"tell me about yourself\") because I did not want to just be boiled down to my ambitions and goals. I focused on talking more about non-academic life and interests whenever I was asked the \"tell me about yourself\" question, and plenty of interviewers at other schools received this well, having a good amount to say about my background.\n\n* A good number of my interview responses / interactions felt pretty solid (i.e. the time went by fast, had good conversation with my interviewer, plenty of back-and-forth), but there were definitely some schools where I felt I was leaning more towards \"rambling\" (having to explain / provide more context). I will say that I felt that this depended on the style of questions interviewers asked (more open-ended questions as opposed to back-and-forth style)\n   * At the same time, I didn't think my interview responses or approach varied too much between schools and I still managed to net three acceptances, so I can't imagine that it was too much of a problem if any\n* I'm monolingual lmao\n* For some reason I was super nervous during my UCI interview, moreso than any of my other ones?? Honestly not really sure why lol but I think my student interviewer could sense it\n* Tech was my first interview and so I feel like I was still trying to figure out how to communicate authentically during interviews at that point, don't think it was a great fit either way\n* Research: did not really push for trying to get on publications or presenting or anything, also did not really have much of a chance to elevate my role as a research volunteer / have more independence\n   * Ultimately I do NOT regret not doing more research. I feel that I got more out of the other things I was spending time on. Would not change a thing here, even if it would have strengthened my app in theory.\n\n# Thought process behind how I chose my undergrad and scheduled myself in college\n\n* I chose not to apply to a lot of private schools for college because I didn't think that there was enough of a difference in the ability of these schools to open doors for medical school to justify such a high price tag. I applied mostly to the UCs with a mid-tier privates.\n* After I received decisions from colleges towards the end of my senior year of high school, I had narrowed down decisions to three UC schools, including UCLA and two \"mid-tier\" schools. I had received scholarships at the latter two. Ultimately decided to go with one of the latter two schools for a few reasons\n   * The scholarship money was a non-trivial amount (20k total over four years)\n   * My final choice school is much more lenient with AP credits than UCLA is. I would have had to retake gen chem and gen bio at UCLA, but freeing up my schedule at my school of choice basically gave me more flexibility to both add on two minors and to fit extracurriculars (the thing that will set you apart for med school admissions) into my schedule\n   * My understanding was that prestige of your undergraduate institution matters much less than what you are able to accomplish there. Didn't think it was worth giving up the benefits mentioned above just because UCLA has more name recognition\n* FWIW, at my UCI interview, there was one girl who was an olympian from Stanford. There were also several students who graduated from smaller Cal State schools. Both ended up at the same place (interviewing with UCI). Similarly, even though a lot of interviewers at Harvard were Ivy or other elite private schools, there were definitely some other interviewees who came from either smaller schools or public schools. \n* Regarding scheduling, I not only tried to pick higher rated professors, but also once things were in-person, I tried to 1) stack classes on the same day where possible (usually T/Th) 2) choose classes without mandatory attendance\n   * This allowed me to work part-time continuously through the second half of college, as I would typically have MWF free to go in for scribing shifts\n   * Overall I think podcasting and watching lectures sped up was also more time efficient than watching lectures live lol\n* At the end of the day I do think things paid off and worked out more or less how I wanted them to! I ended up having more opportunities here than I could have imagined\n\n# AP Credits\n\n* I came into college with credits for AP Bio, AP Chem, AP Calc BC, APUSH, AP Lang, AP HuG, AP Euro, AP Gov, and AP Econ\n* Since I submitted my scores, I had no option to retake the intro level courses I was exempt from (lower division bio, lower division chemistry, calculus I-II)\n* I wasn't worried about fulfilling biology requirements for medical school, but there was some worry about whether my math or chemistry would be sufficient\n   * **Math:**\n   * The only additional math I took was a single statistics course\n   * I found that at most schools the requirements were either minimal (1-2 terms of either calc or stats), they were satisfied by taking physics, or they took my AP credit\n   * **Chemistry:**\n   * This was a concern of mine from the beginning of college. I passed out of the first full year of gen chem and started organic chemistry in year 1. I had heard from some people that this wouldn't fly with med schools. After looking into it a bit more, my sense was that most medical schools were trending towards either accepting AP credits, or not having strict requirements so I figured I would probably be okay. Either way, I understood my options as either being 1) take the honors version of gen chem which was basically like baby p-chem 2) retake gen chem at a community college 3) take upper division chemistry courses\n   * I didn't decide until my third year or so that I wanted to add a chemistry minor, which wasn't too much trouble since there was some overlap with my major. I took biochemistry in the chemistry department, two inorganic chemistry classes, and an upper division biochemistry lab. Ultimately decided to do this 1) so there would be no question about my fulfillment of chemistry prereqs 2) bc I was interested in learning inorganic chem lol\n   * When I was preparing to apply, I cross checked the MSAR requirements with the requirements listed on every school's website. I would say less than 5 schools total would have had issues had I NOT taken inorganic (and applied straight up with AP Chem(Many schools either accept the AP credit if it shows up on your transcript, or they count their chemistry requirement as both \"chemistry and organic chemistry\" and so finishing up ochem essentially demonstrates that you're competent\n\n# Community College Courses\n\n* I ended up taking a few CC classes while I was in college, during summers, during terms, and during my gap year\n* Reasons were\n   * Fulfill GEs including humanities and foreign language\n   * Taking sociology for MCAT background\n   * Taking classes simply out of interest\n   * Sometimes options for these classes @ my undergrad were not flexible with attendance or were already filled up by time of enrollment\n* Just wanted to point this out to make people aware that this is an option to supplement your undergrad coursework (or perhaps to take some \"GPA booster\" classes for cheaper than you would at your undergrad)\n* Was never brought up as a negative thing in interviews\n\n# Tips both for people who are still in undergrad\n\nBe very protective of time for your hobbies and personal interests. It can only help you in this process to be able to demonstrate that you're more than just clinical skills and grades. Both in terms of helping you to stand out and to protect against burnout in this process.\n\nIn a similar boat, be sure to reflect frequently on how you're spending your time week by week and term by term. You want to be selective with and protective of your time. If you find that you're dreading showing up to lab week after week, chances are it's probably not a good idea to keep at it even if it may benefit your application on paper. Likewise, make sure to make time for the things that energize you, and give yourself things to be excited about on a regular basis (both professionally and nonprofessionally). I would encourage you to try to spend time exploring opportunities that are outside of your comfort zone, looking for ways to engage with and serve people that are unlike yourself.\n\nHighly recommend finding a copy of Organic Chemistry as a Second Language by Klein to use as a supplement (or to lightly pre-study) when you take organic chemistry. Really has you focus on understanding arrow pushing and more of the “logic.” of organic chemistry. Will get you much further than just memorizing reactions and guessing. \n\n# Application + Interviewing\n\nTry to minimize use of overused/buzzwordy terms (\"I'm passionate about ...\" or \"care of the underserved\") where possible, see if you can focus on more precisely describing how you feel about certain things. If you're dropping words like \"marginalized\" and \"healthcare disparities\" and \"inequities\" every other sentence, your words may start to sound empty.\n\nIn your writing and interviews, it is okay to acknowledged deficiencies in our system while also trying not to come across as overly negative, critical, or cynical. Something I see a lot in essays I've reviewed is essentially along the lines of \"the patient was dismissed by emergency department after emergency department...\" \"...and the patient told me, \"you're the first person who has actually tried to listened to me\" which basically comes off as \"I can do better than you\"\n\nTread carefully when talking about certain aspects of mental health that might make adcoms doubt your ability to keep up with the demands of medical school. BUT do note that it's unfair to simply dismiss any discussion of mental-health related challenges or therapy as taboo in this process. Anecdotally, I did find success when discussing my experiences and takeaways from engaging in therapy to address social anxiety + self-image issues, and bullying in the past, which was well received in interviews and ultimately one of the things that helped earn me a scholarship.\n\nTry not to stress too much over what you classify their activities as on your application. Remember, the thing that is going to stick with adcoms and give them a sense of who you are and how you think is HOW YOU WRITE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE, not whether you classified your tutoring experience as “teaching” or “volunteering.” Focus on writing compelling, reflective, narrative based experience descriptions where you can.\n\nYour personal statement should FIRST AND FOREMOST answer the question WHY MEDICINE. I have seen a lot of personal statements that talk about things ranging from their time and accomplishments in the lab, volunteering in a nonclincal capacity, or talking about their personal / family history. I have also read personal statements that essentially just list off a person's responsibilities. Some of these things are OK to mention to a limited extent, but ultimately if someone who didn't know you read this PS and could not clearly summarize why it is that you want to be a physician specifically (and not a teacher, not a scientist, not a nurse, not a social worker), then you probably need to revise your PS. Usually for most people this will mean that the personal statement will include at least some personal experience either as a patient or interacting with a patient, as well as some first-hand experience seeing a physician (or multiple) at work + their impact.\n\nI'm of the opinion that most people should not be focusing heavily on research in their personal statement, especially if you don't intend on getting an MD-PhD or becoming a physician scientist in the future. Ideally, a good amount of your PS will focus on clinical encounters/anecdotes and include some things that you've learned about the healthcare system and what it means to be a doctor, while also making a case for what it is you like about this work. Again, these are the things that will most directly answer that question of why medicine. One last tips is that one way that you can frame some of your PS is that you're looking to do MORE than what you've already done or build on existing skills from a job or position you've had, have more autonomy/agency etc.\n\nEspecially if you’re a CA applicant please apply broadly :,,,) Look into OOS publics that are friendly, not just privates. \n\nWhen you’re putting together a school list, I HIGHLY recommend cross-checking individual school websites with the MSAR, especially when taking note of LOR and course requirements including AP policy. I used a spreadsheet to keep track of everything and take notes on things like LOR requirements, courses etc. In most cases, MSAR aligns with school policies, but there were definitely a few cases I came across where MSAR was missing some info. \n\n# Thoughts on having physician parents + privilege\n\nA recurring topic I've seen on this subreddit is people talking about how the process is unfair because there are people who have physicians as parents. While I do agree that applications with physicians as parents are definitely at a significant advantage, I wanted to take the opportunity to weigh in with some perspective as someone whose parents are both in medicine.\n\nI can think of a few main benefits of having physicians in medicine as parents\n\n* Having more insight into the variety of careers that exist within medicine beyond just clinical work (such as administrative roles, educational roles), as well as perspective on what medical school and residency might be like (having a better sense of what you're getting into)\n* Gaining perspective on how to balance family life with medicine\n* Connections to medical school classmates or colleagues who might be willing to let you shadow\n   * At the same time though, I tried to leverage this and share the same opportunities with friends who needed shadowing hours!!\n   * Ultimately I do think that something needs to change in terms of how available opportunities for shadowing are for all students...\n* Financial support to apply broadly, travel for interviews, MCAT resources\n   * Similarly, financial freedom to not have to be constrained to working a particular type of job, or having the privilege to volunteer your time to boost your application\n   * This is a major talking point I see, but I would argue that this advantage exists for anyone who has parents who are in a relatively high-paying job, even if it's not healthcare or healthcare-adjacent\n   * In that sense the issue is less about some applicants having more money than others and more that that is able to influence how well someone's cycle goes in the first place. Prepping for the MCAT, taking it, applying, and interviewing should not be nearly as costly as they are. It'll be hard to achieve equity in medicine while those with higher disposable income still have these advantages.\n\nAt the same time, I think there are some things that are not mentioned as frequently\n\n* There were times when my parents discouraged me from engaging in some of the activities that I decided to engage in. For instance, my mom (an emergency medicine physician) strongly discouraged me from volunteering in hospice because she thought it would be too depressing and push me away from medicine. Just because someone's parents are in medicine does not necessarily mean that their opinions are 100% what is right for their kid and will benefit their application.\n   * To that end, most of the activities I chose to engage in were different from what my parents would have recommended to me. I never did any sort of hospital volunteering like they had encouraged me to at first because I was concerned I would just be changing linens and refilling water. They had also discouraged me from working during college, saying I didn't need the money, but I ended up going for the scribe job anyways and it ended up being one of my greatest learning experiences.\n* On your application you do have to indicate if you have parents with medical degrees. Do keep in mind this is something that some interviewers will almost certainly prod you about and challenge you on \"do you really want to go into medicine for yourself? did your parents push you into it?\" Furthermore, if your primary clinical experience is something like working in your dad's office, chances are that won't be very well received by admissions committees. \n* Legacy(?) -- while this may have some effect at some schools still, I do think that more and more schools are making an effort not to give an advantage to students solely based off legacy. Anecdotal but I ultimately ended up getting rejected from the school where both of my parents are alumni (the topic came up during that interview too lol)\n* The application process is so different now than it was 20-30+ years ago. I've had to educate my parents (and they have had to educate themselves) on what some of the expectations and norms are now. Both of my parents applied and got in with simple hospital volunteering for less than 100 hours as their only clinical experience. Gap years were almost unheard of. DO school was stigmatized much more then than now. Applying Caribbean with a weaker application was more normalized. Some people applied to dental school in the same cycle they applied to med school as a back-up.\n   * Similarly, the MCAT has changed significantly since then, and so have the resources for prep. In no way could my parents have directly pointed me towards the most effective way or resources to study for the exam. The most they could do was help provide financial support for said resources.\n   * Because of this I think the benefits of having an \"older\" physician mentor / role model are definitely substantial, but more limited than some might think.\n* There is no excuse for snobby, pretentious behavior, or gross exercises of privilege (e.g. a physician tacking on their kid's names to a publication). But I would just like to remind folks that at the end of the day that if you're hoping to have kids yourself, chances are that once you are a physician, you will also want to do what you can to help them succeed, whether that's supporting them financially, connecting them with your colleagues, etc. So please try and be careful about making assumptions and generalizations about peers just because they come from privilege. It doesn't cost much to choose to be kind or open-minded.\n\n# FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI’m incredibly grateful for how this cycle turned out. While the process definitely tested my patience and confidence at times, I feel proud of the application I put forward and the person I presented to schools. There’s no perfect formula or background for this process, and there are things I could have done differently, but I wouldn’t trade the experiences I pursued. If you're someone who’s still figuring things out or who feels a little behind, know that you’re not alone, and that your path is still completely valid. Feel free to reach out if you have questions about anything. I wouldn’t be here without the guidance of others, and I’m happy to pay it forward!\n\n"

    "body": "A year ago, I opened my REA decision from (what I thought was) my dream school to find out I had been rejected. While I knew going into it that highly selective college admissions can't be predicted by anyone or anything, I had let myself hope for an acceptance. As a naturally anxious person, it took a lot of effort to lean into that hope throughout the fall and not believe I'd be a de facto reject. I let myself believe the most likely result would be deferral, and that I would continue to finish my applications largely unaffected.\n\nWhile I did mourn the school itself, the hardest part of my rejection was how it changed my thinking about my college process as a whole. I felt stupid for letting myself hope, and began to believe my college list was too reachy—if I couldn't even get deferred from my early school, how would I get accepted to the similarly selective schools I was RDing to? It didn't help that it felt like everyone I knew was bound to a school through an ED acceptance while I trudged through finishing my applications.\n\nThree months later, I was accepted to nearly every school I applied to. Past that early rejection, only two colleges did not send me an offer of admission. Even the essays I wrote in a hurry, fully believing that there was no point spending time with painstaking editing because I was bound for rejection, worked. I know now that if I had chosen to apply early to virtually any school on my list other than my REA school, I would have been accepted—and I am so, so thankful I didn't do that, and got rejected instead.\n\nI would have never in a million years applied ED to the school I chose. It was the last college I toured and the last school I decided to apply to. I didn't think I would get accepted, much less attend. While I can't say I can't imagine myself anywhere else—people are right when they say you can be happy at any institution—I absolutely and totally cannot FATHOM attending my REA school. I would have never felt comfortable expanding my horizons the way I have since coming to college if I was at a school with a classic grind culture—and, more importantly, if I felt like I was culminating my high school dreams by going to college. Being in a place I never expected to be means I have total freedom. I have more friends than I've ever had before—not just friends of convenience, but people I have genuine connections to. I love college as much as I dreamed I would. I know I wouldn't feel the same if I went to my \"dream school.\"\n\nGetting rejected from Yale was one of the best things to ever happen to me. I mean that genuinely. I know the \"rejection is redirection\" phrase can feel cliché and often painful, but know that things really do work out the way everyone tells you they will. Know, also, that it's never stupid to hope. One school's decision has no bearing on any other decision, and, more importantly, has no bearing on your accomplishments and efforts that have gotten you this far. Last year, I was so terrified of hope that I decided against ED2 in fear of opening another rejection letter. I didn't get over that fear until I got my first major RD-round acceptance. Don't do that!!! Let your hopes and desires carry you through the rest of this process, and know that surprises can be the biggest blessings."

    "body": "There’s a moment in every college advising cycle where someone asks if they should shell out $4,000+ to do a pre-college program at a big-name school. Usually, it comes with a question like: *Will this help me stand out?* Or W*ill it give me a leg up in admissions?*\n\nThe short answer is not in the way most people think.\n\nThey won’t “boost” your app just by existing on your activities list, and no, they won’t magically get you into that school (or any school). Sure, there are a few highly selective programs out there with instant name-recognition, but for the most part, AOs know they’re usually pay-to-play. \n\nSo are they a waste of money?\n\nSometimes, yes. Especially if you’re going for name brand alone. But sometimes they’re actually very worthwhile. Not because of how they look, but because of what they can do for your growth as a student and thinker.\n\nHere’s the real value: when a pre-college program helps you go deeper into an academic area you already care about, it can shape how you write and think. If you're exploring neuroscience and your class sparks a new line of thinking that ends up in a “Why Major” supplement, that's meaningful. If you're knee-deep in urban policy debates at Brown and that helps you figure out that poli sci *isn’t* for you after all, that’s also a win.\n\nIn that way, a pre-college program can clarify what academic curiosity looks like for you, and if you're really paying attention, that clarity can ripple across your writing. Especially in supplements, where depth of thought and direction will matter more than the name of a class.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that there are better and worse versions of these programs. If you’re considering one, ask questions like: Will I have access to actual professors? Will I be writing or doing independent work? What kind of feedback will I get?\n\nAnd what if you can’t afford one? Please don’t panic. You don’t need an official program to explore your interests in a meaningful way. \n\nIf you’re looking for inspiration, think small and specific. A student once emailed their city planner to ask about local transit issues and ended up attending public meetings and writing a short op-ed. That’s not a “program,” but it’s the kind of summer work that shows thought and initiative and gives you something real to write about come essay season.\n\nYou can volunteer locally in a way that aligns with your academic interest (environmental science + local waterway cleanup; public health + food pantry logistics). You could launch a small self-directed project, like a short research paper, a digital art portfolio, or even a podcast episode if you’re curious about media. Or you might offer tutoring or mentorship to younger students in a subject you care about. \n\nNone of these needs to be flashy. They just need to be real. A summer that reflects honest curiosity and thoughtful effort could do a lot more for your applications (and your growth) than a five-figure dorm stay in Cambridge.\n\nHas anyone here done a pre-college program? Curious to hear how it went for you."

    "score": 32,
    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1n9eohh/how_exactly_do_you_approach_the_uchicago_uncommon/",
    "body": "**Background**: I'm a UChicago alum who has reviewed hundreds of college apps and mentored 20+ students who went to UChicago. I fully understand the notoriety of the \"Uncommon essay\" and know many students who decided not to apply just because of this requirement. In my personal experience, the quirky essay could actually be a very valuable tool to showcase who you are - if you do it right. But it's definitely not easy to figure out how to do it \"right\" when you're given so much flexibility and so little instructions.\n\nI get requests from frustrated applicants every year, and many of them ask the same questions: \"What prompt am I supposed to choose?\" \"Is this supposed to be full-on creative, or should I showcase some of my skills/experience?\" \"What exactly are they looking for with this essay?\"\n\nAll of these questions are valid and important. I feel like I've finally gone through this process with enough students to write a post about my take. My goal is to help out anyone who's thinking about applying to UChicago but are a little intimidated by the essay.\n\n**Disclaimer**: This is by no means a \"definitive\" guide. There is not a singular \"perfect\" way to approach the UChicago uncommon essay, or any essay for that matter. I'm merely sharing my opinions, which are synthesized from my own experience as an applicant and as a mentor for other successful applicants.\n\nHope this can sway some of you who are on the fence into the right direction (and good luck to those who have already submitted ED0)!\n\n\\*please excuse any typos\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\nWhat exactly is UChicago looking for?\n\nBefore you start the essay, you really need to figure out this question. Like with any other college, you need to understand the *type* of student that the AO is looking for to best tailor your narrative. Many students make the mistake of tweaking the wording for different schools while keeping the same core ideas. This is an easy mistake to make when many of the prompts seem similar (like \"why school\" or \"why major\"). But generalizing your responses is not a good strategy because every school's angle is different, and you're giving up the golden opportunity to speak to each school's vision and maximize your chances.\n\nThe idea is the exact same with UChicago - except the task *literally* forces you to tailor your response. The UChicago app enforces more self-selection because of the unique prompt, but in reality, every school looks for a different set of traits regardless of how similar the prompts might seem.\n\nThis is exactly why I'm saying that the Uncommon essay could be a great opportunity to showcase yourself. Compared to how easy it is to write generic stuff for common prompts, the Uncommon essay literally makes it impossible for you to do so. Unfortunately, many students do not realize the value of the prompt's design and either 1. pass up on it entirely or 2. write some generic fluff while complaining about how annoying it is.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\nNow, how do you do it right?\n\nLet's start with choosing the prompt. I recommend avoiding analysis paralysis and letting your instinct guide you. Usually students don't have too much trouble finding one or two that speak to them after reading through the near-infinite list. Unless you really really hate all of them (very very unlikely), you should go with a pre-existing prompt instead of coming up with your own.\n\nEither way you shouldn't spend too much time analyzing the prompts, because your response matters a lot more than the question. A creative response to a basic question is always better than a boring response to an interesting question.\n\nOnce you have an initial idea, it's time to double down. I'm an advocate for committing to a prompt once you've made any progress. Even if you start to hate your first idea, focusing on one prompt allows you to dig deeper and discover new angles. I'm issuing a preemptive warning to students like me who are very thorough and prone to overthinking (ironically a common trait at UChicago). DO NOT BE SCARED TO COMMIT.\n\nI'd approach the writing process like the Personal Statement. Start early and give yourself space to think instead of doing it in one go. Most students I know pivot 3+ times before settling on a final story, myself included. There are many important decisions to make:\n\n>1. What is your literal response to the question?\n\nIf you had to respond to the question in one sentence, what would it be? This would be the guidepost to your essay, but it does not have to be explicitly written out in your essay.\n\n>2. What style of writing are you going for?\n\nAre you trying to approach the prompt through an argumentative, creative, or narrative lens? Most students do a combination of the three, and if so, what percentage of each are you using? What is the overall tone of voice (philosophical, humorous, fantastical...)?\n\nThe sky is the limit here. I would recommend balancing being adventurous and doing what you're best at. Let your strengths shine, but don't be afraid to experiment with styles you aren't used to. I really believe that the writing process could be enjoyable this way.\n\n>3. What traits are you demonstrating through this essay?\n\nJust like the Personal Statement, this essay needs to be wielded into a piece of armor that strengthens your profile. Whether it's your domain expertise, creativity, mastery of language, or a unique life experience, you need to use the prompt to highlight something special about you. If you've read some sample essays, you'll see some common traits emerge regardless of how exactly the essay is written - these underlying signals what the readers are looking for.\n\nStyle is important but don't let it take over the substance.\n\n>4. How does this fit within your profile?\n\nWhile you could zoom in on something hyper-specific with this 650-word essay, you still need to consider how it compliments your entire narrative on paper. How does your response showcase something you haven't mentioned elsewhere? How can you make a case for yourself as a prospective UChicago student? How does it add to your multidimensionality and help readers know you better?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\nHow exactly you make these decisions is very very specific to you; there is no one-size-fit-all solution. But I find the general methodology here to be helpful for 99% of students. Even if you don't follow any of the steps I outlined, just understanding the ideology behind this prompt would make the process 100x smoother and more enjoyable for you (I realize that the Life of the Mind is really coming through in this post). \n\nThe UChicago prompt is intentionally self-selective, but I personally believe that anyone could write a great Uncommon essay. You shouldn't let the prompt discourage you if the school itself interests you in any way.\n\nAs an aside: I know some people are saying that the Common App is ruining school-specific \"culture.\" While I couldn't agree more with preserving culture and legacy, with the increasing competition every year, the best thing any applicant could do is to understand the vision of each school and give it your best shot. I genuinely think that every 18-year-old is malleable and the Life of the Mind is not dead (yet).\n\nIf you signed up for the game, you might as well play it right.\n\nGood luck and I'll try to answer any questions."

    "body": "I come from a family where we don't make much money, and have to live by paycheck. My mother is a stay at home, and my father is the only one who works. Both are getting near to their 60s, and his annual salary is <75000, but we have almost nothing in savings. Like, we have only a few thousand. Rent takes up most of the salary as well. I will be paying for my full university costs. Tuition, boarding, food, everything.\n\nWhile a lot of the top schools have good tuition coverage, such as the Ivy's, RICE, I do know that I won't be able to make it into any of them, especially since my major is CS. That leaves me with the others.\n\nMy grades are alright, but I wasn't really in the know about how the college system worked in the U.S., and I don't have much ECs as of now.\n\nI believe that I can get into more (comparatively) better options like a t100, places like UCR, if I can work it, but I just don't feel as if the oos tuition would be worth it. And I believe it isn't.\n\nThe best in-state option is the University of Kansas for me, and it's a respectable school, I plan to go there, my brother has went there, and I'm happy to get an education, but in no ways is the school selective (89% acceptance) and prestigious so that I could have something to appeal to employers and get a job in today's economy. I feel as if all my work will be for nothing.\n\nI've asked around, and a lot of people are saying that college does not matter unless it is t20, and I should even take cc and then transfer. But a lot of other people are saying that college is relevant for DS, and while there are people who have built up and come from state schools, that is the minority and employers usually hire those from good colleges. \n\nI just need a job. I'm looking to survive for now. But the recent job economy, especially for CS, isn't good anymore, and about everybody has a degree as a given. \n\nAnd please don't get me wrong. I have nothing against KU, and I'm planning on going there. It's just that there are so many good schools out there that I think I could have a chance, and some I reacherched and found that I really liked, and it's a little crushing that I can't attend them because of money.\n\nEven with financial aid, 30k is 30k. I cannot afford that. Hell, even 20k is just despair inducing. \n\nThere's a whole lot of everything else, and this isn't the full picture, but it is what it is. \n\nI plan to go into either cs, math, stats, and then into DS for my masters, and I was wondering how much my university would affect my career. \n\n"

    "body": "After years of hard work and persistence, I finally received an offer for a one-year Master's program at MIT Sloan. I'm thrilled about this opportunity, but the financial reality is daunting: tuition is $86,000 and living expenses around $35,000, totaling approximately $120,000 for just one year of education.\n\n（It’s actually like a one year MBA equivalent program, so the cost is also similar, and any other master programs at Sloan also cost the same or even higher)\n\n**My background:** I've been working as a product manager in the tech industry for several years. I've held positions at major Chinese internet companies and also worked at some startups. Despite this experience, I feel my career progress has plateaued. There are certain ideal positions that seem just out of reach—I feel like I'm missing something, especially for AI-related product management roles.\n\n**About the program:** This is a one-year Master's program at MIT Sloan with very flexible course selection, allowing me to completely customize my curriculum based on my interests and career goals.\n\n**Career goals:** After completing this degree, I want to work as an AI product manager (either in the US or elsewhere). I know US tech job market is like a hell now for international students, so I am open to work outside of US.\n\n**The immigration factor:** I'm not particularly set on staying in the US long-term, especially given the current immigration environment, which makes remaining in the US quite challenging. However—and this is the tricky part—product management roles in the US pay significantly more than anywhere else in the world. So from a purely ROI perspective, if I don't stay in the US post-graduation, it's difficult to justify the investment financially.\n\n**My dilemma:** I might have a somewhat irrational attachment to prestigious schools, which is influencing my decision. MIT has been something of a dream for me, but the current situation is extremely challenging. If I wait 3 years to apply again, there's no guarantee I'd be accepted. At the same time, taking on $120,000 in debt for a one-year program feels overwhelming, especially if I can't secure a US position afterward. Long-term, I'm certain I want to continue working in the tech/AI field, so this education would align with my career trajectory.\n\n**Additional context:** I'm doing an 1-year MBA program at one of Europe's top business schools, I will graduate in June, and I'm interviewing for two high-paying positions (the interviews are going to be very challenging, so I think my chances are slim). However, neither of these opportunities align with my ideal career path as an AI product manager. Originally, my plan was to work for a year after my MBA to save money for this MIT program, but unfortunately, MIT doesn't allow deferment for this particular master's program.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any advice and thoughts!"

And this cannot be because all generic rankings use methodology that might not align with your particular preferences, and it makes a lot more sense for each person to figure out which schools align best with their preferences.

So here I am, saving the day.  \n\nMy methodology is specifically designed to identify institutions focused on undergraduate experience, including holistic student development, ethical leadership, global preparedness, and a strong academic environment.

Metrics: participation in undergraduate study abroad programs, diversity of undergraduate international students and faculty interacting with undergraduates, integration of global issues and diverse cultural perspectives into undergraduate coursework, strength of language programs and regional studies centers relevant to undergraduates.\n\n4.     Academic Selectivity (15%): reflects the academic strength of the incoming undergraduate class.  Metrics: Average SAT/ACT scores and average high school GPA of admitted undergraduate students.\n\nScores are entirely qualitative.\n\nRank    Institution                               Total    SCL     ELS     GE            AS\n\n1          University of Notre Dame      97.8     98.5     98.0     95.0        92.0\n\n2          Williams College                    97.5     99.5     94.0     93.0        99.0\n\n3          Georgetown University          97.2     95.5     97.5     97.0        88.0\n\n4          Amherst College                     96.9     99.0     93.5     92.5       99.5\n\n5          Princeton University               96.5     96.0     94.0     92.5        99.8\n\n6          Swarthmore College               96.3     98.0     92.0     91.0        98.5\n\n7          Duke University                     95.8     95.0     90.0     91.5          97.5\n\n8          Pomona College                     95.5     97.5     91.0     90.0         98.0\n\n9          Boston College                       95.2     97.0     96.0     93.5         80.0\n\n10        Tufts University                      94.8     95.5     91.0     95.0          87.0\n\n11        Yale University                       94.5     96.0     92.5     95.5           99.0\n\n12        Harvard University                 94.3     95.0     93.0     96.0           99.8\n\n13        Wake Forest University          93.7     94.5     92.5     88.0           82.0\n\n14        Vanderbilt University             92.5     94.0     89.0     89.5           85.0\n\n15        Columbia University              92.0     92.0     90.0     96.5           98.5\n\n16        U of Southern California        90.8     89.5     85.0     90.0            90.0\n\n17        University of Virginia             90.5     91.0     87.0     88.0            88.0\n\n18        Middlebury College                90.2     95.0     88.0     94.0            85.0"

As I continue into my first year of graduate school, I have been thinking back to my undergraduate years and how lost/confused I was when navigating schools. So, with my past four years, I am going to put my tips and tricks to surviving college! This will be split into three sections: Dormitory/Housing, Academics, and finances. You can feel free to add in, agree, or disagree! This has been my experience, but I know there are many out there with different experiences. Enjoy! \n\nPrior to starting, I feel the need to add this in. Community college is something that is debated a lot, and if I were to go back five years ago (putting athletics aside and purely financial), I would have absolutely taken the route to community college. Financially, it is the smartest option (in my opinion); for those who are able to, staying up at home and saving money off of rent/housing/meal plans is absolutely amazing. Yes, there might be limitations in the classes at community colleges, but the fact that you are getting a degree AT ALL is amazing! There is no shame in community college, and it really is an amazing avenue for anyone looking to get a degree. Of course, there are limitations in regard to the types of classes and degrees offered, but community colleges, as a whole, are financially highly recommended and once you get your degree, you can choose to transfer to a larger college if you wish.\nAhem, anyways. Let’s get on to it! \n\n**MAJOR DISCLAIMER: This post is too long, so part 2 will be in the comments (or an entirely different post depending on length)**\n\n**Disclaimer: There will be a few cusses in here, but they will be censored. It is all lighthearted!**  \n\n**Disclaimer Two: All links to products will be at the bottom of this entire thing. I am not sponsored by anything, so please no company sue me or that’d really suck.** \n\n \n\nDormitory/Housing: Ah, so you finally made it to college! No more mom, no more siblings, no more curfew, just you and the REAL world! You’re a little nervous, but that’s alright! Everyone else is as scared/nervous as you are! You go through orientation (God that took so many hours, right?!), and everything sounds absolutely amazing. Plus, you got a bunch of free t-shirts, bags, and cups. However, as you make your way to your empty dorm, you can’t help feeling doubt clouding your mind. Totally cool. Let’s go through a couple questions and recommendations that I have for a wide variety of people! \n\n \n\n**1.** You are super excited to get into your room and start decorating! You have been waiting for this since you were fourteen (or even younger). The world is your oyster, you have Pinterest boards, written writeups, and you and your roommate are ready to take on the world. Well, except you realize that buying these decorations is really f-ing expensive. You got to target, and oh my goodness a single plush throw is THIRTY-FIVE FLIPPING DOLLARS. You have five hundred dollars in your back account and a dream (if even that)! Everyone is always saying how Target is so affordable, but for me, I have found it to be the biggest scam. They charge you a lot for what is supposed to be actually affordable. However, don’t you worry, I got some tricks for you! \n\nOkay OP, so where am I supposed to go? Target? Walmart? The thrift store? Well, believe it or not, you can shop at Target and Walmart, and I have a few links to where you can find affordable items for those stores with different items. But I have a few better spots that are more financially friendly for college students. \n\nThe first spot(s) are TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. I know I know; you can walk into one of these places and leave with 400$ worth of stuff in a blink. However, when it comes to getting small things such as: bedding, blankets, rugs, and tubber ware, I find these sister stores to be a god send. I have gotten nearly all my towels from HomeGoods.  \n\nGood towels can go for 10$ which can be pricey, but there is a deal at HomeGoods (or sometimes Tj Maxx) where they have a set of towels (Rachel Zoe, Tahari, Ecotery, etc.) that include: two bath towels, two wash clothes, and two hand towels for 24.99$. Y’all, you don’t need forty-seven towels, I have five bath towels I rotate and three towel turbans that I use for my hair. You can reuse your towels (cleaning them of course). The reason I say to go to Tj Maxx of HomeGoods is because a Rachel Zoe towel set can run you 50 + dollars easily. Of course, if you don’t want a towel set, you can get individual towels from 6.99-12.99. But, as I say, that is a pretty penny. I suggest these sets, however, there are other stores that offer similar options! Those include target, Walmart, bed bath and beyond, and Khol’s (just to name a few!). I have a few options at the bottom of this entire thing! The only downside for TJ Maxx and HomeGoods is their website is pretty bad, so I would recommend going in person. \n\nOkay, so towels! Damn you can go on a long time about towels. What about bedding? Rugs? And all that other jazz? HomeGoods is my go-to for bedding, entirely so. You can get good sheets sets for 19.99 and blankets for 14.99 and on. I prefer to not use a comforter and just drown in over the size throws. In addition to HomeGoods, you can also try Ross, where I found a bunch of similar things for the same prices so and so. Links will be listed below for sheets and blankets. \n\nImportant note! You, yes you. I am talking to you. Some folks don’t know this, but it is recommended to clean your bedding every two weeks. It can be a hassle, especially if you want to do nothing but sleep, but if you want to feel clean in the morning and after a shower: clean your bed sheets and blankets. I do so every two weeks, and some folks might scream, but I put my sheets in the washer and dryer and just run it either hot or warm water. For blankets, I tend to do a warm setting, and I always always always do heavy load setting. Get that filth out. You and your roommate will thank you for cleaning your bed sheets. \n\n**Tip 1**: I recommend having two to three sets of bed sheets; yes, you heard me right. I have two “good” sets of bed sheets that I switch on and off while cleaning the others. I then have one kind of mid set of bed sheets that I use for “if only I am too lazy to clean the others one”. It makes life a helluva lot easier if you don’t feel like washing your bed sheets, so you can just pop the new ones on and put the other ones to be washed later on. \n\n**Tip 2**: Because this doesn’t fit with the above, I recommend using queen or even king-sized bed sheets (I use queen). The reason being that there is nothing I hate more than waking up with my bed sheets coming off of my mattress and sleeping on an icky mattress pad or mattress. Having queen or king sets, you don’t have to worry about that as much. \n\nThe second spots I like for decorating purposes are: five below, dollar tree, dollar general, and Target/Walmart 1,3, and 5$ shops. Now now, I know what y’all are thinking: didn’t OP just bash target and Walmart? Yes, I absolutely did. Just hear me out. I know, like me, y’all likely want some rad lights, calendars, clocks, etc. But then you go to a normal place and a set of string lights are 15-30$. Like, my brother in love, what??? My favorite spot to go for cool nick knacks is 5 below. You can find a bunch of room decorations in that store, from lights, calendars, clocks, random decorations, etc. Listen, if it’s for decoration, it doesn’t need to be super expensive. Additionally, dollar tree and dollar general are also adequate for said decorations. I just found five below and Tj Maxx/HomeGoods to be the easiest for decorations. \n\nOkay, now you’re probably like: OP what about the whole Target Walmart thing? Well, you see, this is my one tidbit about these two dudes. There is a section y’all see with these two which are the 5$ and below section. These are tailored specifically for college students (and those of us who definitely are not responsible with money), and you can find a lot of neat (small) decorations for cheap! Just be careful how much you add to cart cause that can get expensive.  \n\nThe third spots I like for general laundry detergent, lights, batteries, soaps, etc. are discount stores. Not sure exactly what’s around y’all but where I am we have an Ollie’s bargain store. It is a little bit overwhelming, but with a few deep breaths, you can find main brand laundry detergent, dryer sheets, soaps, cleaning supplies, etc. It will be expensive anywhere to get these cleaning and basic supplies, but I find that bargain stores are your best bet for trying to save any money at all.  \n\n \n\n \n\n**2.** Now you’re probably thinking: holy f\\*ck OP we get it, you like shopping and have probably spent an ungodly amount of money on blankets. Yes, you’re absolutely right. I have. And do I regret it? No. Does my bank account regret it? Yes. So, let’s get along with dorm life recommendations.  \n\nOkay, OP, I have read this far: what should I know about laundry? Well, my friend, I am glad you have asked. You see, your school has likely done the thing where they stuff a bunch of people in one dorm and have given them 2 washers and dryers for 100+ people. And suddenly, it’s Sunday afternoon and you realize you have no clean clothes, and when you try to go to the laundry room, there are people hogging the washers and driers. Oh, and you go to grab your laundry from the drier (literally a minute after it ends) and you catch someone taking your stuff out and putting theirs in. Like, yeahhhhh, no.  \n\nMy recommendation for this conundrum is a bit unusual. Some might like it, some might not. So, when my weekends come around, I know lots of folks will have gone home, out partying, watching football, etc. For boring people like me, I do some of that stuff. However, in the late evenings (and I mean 12 – 4am) I like to do my laundry. No one is here or awake, and no one is certainly worrying about laundry when they can be getting wasted at a bar somewhere. Guess when I wrote this entire thing? Yep, 2:30am doing my laundry. You don’t have to worry about folks stealing your laundry, you don’t have to worry about having enough washers and driers.  \n\nThe downside to this method? You have to be a night owl. You have to be willing to suck it up and be up at the ungodly hours. If you’re like me, you’ll probably be doing a research project, scrolling through reddit, or watching football (I don’t have much of a social life let’s be for real). So, I get the apprehension. If you want a more reasonable time, then you can likely do it earlier in the morning (8am – 10am) when folks are getting ready for lectures. There’s a better chance you can get washers and driers. If you have a day where you have nothing to do, then I recommend the night before getting your washing and cleaning done, that way you can crash without consequences when you are done. \n\nThanks for the tips OP, but how do I even wash my laundry? So, I am not the best person to ask for this. Personally, what I found has worked for me, is putting all my colors together and then all my whites together (I do not promote racism; I am talking about clothes, people). I always wash on hot, heavy load, and normal settings. I want my clothes cleaned, y’all. I don’t care what the labels say (unless what I am washing is expensive). Additionally, I always dry my clothes hot or warm (depending on the material). If it’s expensive, it’s probably air dry or no heat, I would recommend doing that varying on directions.  \n\nOkay, but what about even loading the washer and drier? A common question for those of us who haven’t really done laundry before. You know what’s embarrassing? When you overload the washer and suddenly there is water all over the floor and a washer out of commission for an entire dorm. Then suddenly you get an email to everyone from your RA telling them to NOT OVERFILL THE WASHERS. Couldn’t be me (shivers). So, what do we take from this? It is going to be annoying, but you cannot fill the washer to the rim. Firstly, your sh\\*t won’t get cleaned, and secondly there’s a good chance you will overflow the washer. I fill the washers just over halfway and run my cycle. \n\nThen there is washing detergent and all that fancy stuff. Before even loading my laundry, I put one pod in of laundry detergent and then a whole cup of the smelling stuff (idk what it is called). If you are an athlete, I recommend doing two cups of laundry smelling scent stuff. Also, if you are an athlete, you need to wash your clothes regularly. I know I should not be the one telling you this, but it is better that I tell you this than your roommate or RA.  \n\n \n\n \n\n**3.** Okay, OP thanks for the lecture about laundry (you probably). But what about my roommate? What if I am anti-social as f\\*ck? Well, to be honest, if you’re on reddit, then you got your answer. No, I am just f\\*cking with you. College is a scary place, especially if you’re introverted. Your parents, like mine, probably have said “this is your place to reinvent yourself”, thanks mom and dad. And while you probably think your parents are trying to just have your back, they are actually right. This is something I haven’t done particularly well since going to my new graduate school. It is scary, man. Especially coming in with completely different people, and (if like me) from a completely different part of the country.  \n\nOkay, so what do I do? For me, I play on a sports team. I have found that consistently interacting with these people has given me a social outlet, and we all bond together over something we are passionate about. You are going to have a bunch of different people in one place focusing on the same goal. Yet, it does not just have to be a sport. It can be a club, it can be a football fantasy league, it can be a meet up with a group of people for a club named “socializing 101”. Listen, college is scary. You need to meet your groups of people; that is something I am still learning myself. You don’t need to get stupid drunk to meet folks, you don’t have to change yourself. Finding people in your classes is crucial, try to make study groups. Sometimes, you have to just approach a person and ask them if you can have lunch, talk about school, or something. It’s scary as hell, but that is one way I made genuine friends.  \n\nWhat if I am unsure about my roommate? Oh buddy, let me tell you, I have horror stories about roommates. You have heard stories about roommates. Your 3^(rd) great uncle Joe has horror stories about roommates. We ALL do. Realistically, when going to college and knowing no one, it is super difficult to find a roommate randomly that you f\\*ck with. What I highly recommend is taking that charting thing FR. Talk to these folks, get to know them. And if you get there and y’all hit it off like two peas in a pod? Hell yeah.  \n\nHowever, if you get there and you KNOW it ain’t gonna last longer than Aaron Rodger’s Achilles last season, then what I recommend is talking with your roommate about possible issues that they have and how you can sort them out. If that don’t work, talk to your RA. They don’t get paid enough to deal with that, but they will try their best to sort it out. They’re human, so please be nice to them. And if that does not work, approach the housing resource station (or whatever it is called) and ask them to switch. Explain the situation to them, that you have talked with the RA, and that it is just not going to work. There’s a good chance you will ruin someone’s year with that e-mail that the open spot in their dorm room has been taken over, but there is a 90% chance it will be better than before. And, if you’re lucky, they might have room for a double that is unoccupied.  \n\nIf all else fails and you know you will be miserable with anyone, then I would recommend doing the scary thing and looking into a single. It will be more expensive, that is factual. But, if you’re like me and genuinely cannot have a roommate due to medical issues, then looking into a single is important. It might be worth more, but it also comes with peace of mind. If you know that you will struggle having a roommate no matter who you live with that is a sign that this might be the right path for you. \n\n**Tip 1**: If you have a disability that can be supported by doctor note/diagnosis, reach out to the ADA department at your school and there is a chance they can put you in ADA housing. This is almost always a single for those who have a disability. It can be a struggle to go through, but it is one of the ways that those with disabilities can get the housing appropriate for them. \n\n\\*\\*Tip 2\\*\\*: Do not miss out on room selection. It may be at 6am in the morning on a random Tuesday, but if you miss out on signing up for a good dorm or put on the lottery, you will hate yourself. Have a plan. You need to have a plan; someone you want to have a room with (or a plan for a single you want) and be ready to go to war. Folks will be refreshing wanting that one golden dorm. If you are even an hour late (overexaggerating for some colleges), then you are getting the worst dormitory in the school (the one where the only two toilets on the floor are always clogged or out of order and the community kitchen is always gross and being used). So be prepared.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\\*\\*4\\*\\*. Okay, so: buying stuff, laundry, and roommates, that’s great and all, but here are a few miscellaneous things that don’t really fit with the rest. First thing first, I’m gonna lecture you on bedtimes, routines, and all that. If your parents haven’t done it, I am going to. Unlike me (it is currently just past 3am now), you need to have steady bedtime. It is not elementary school, but you need to have a bedtime you try to stick to. For me, I have work in the mornings, so I am typically going to bed around 12am and waking up at 7am. Except you, my child, needs to be sleeping 7 to 9 hours a day. Sleep is crucial to learning, surviving, and all that jazz. Don’t trust me? Take it from Cornell, UNC, even the freaking CDC. You can probably survive at 4, 5, or 6 hours. But do I recommend it? No. Not only will your learning retention be shortened, but you will feel like shit. It does not matter how much coffee you get or how many sodas you down, you need your damn sleep.  \n\nOP I need to study though? And I have sports? Like, what do you expect of me? I get it, as a STEM major and college athlete, getting sleep is ridiculously difficult. What you need to do is have a plan. You need to plan out your assignments, you need to stick to a studying schedule, and you need to stick to a routine. It is so easy to get carried away at 2am watching videos on how to build a fortress out of toothpicks. We have all been there. But then you have to be to practice at 6am and suddenly you can’t fall asleep for the life of you. Then it is 330am and you get a little bit of sleep and then BEEP BEEP BEEP, your five something am alarm is going off. At that point, was it even worth getting sleep?  \n\nSo, in short, you have to work in a routine. Find one you can work with, whether it is going to bed at 9pm or 1am. Yes, I said 1am. If you can at least be steady and work in a system that you are used to, then you can learn to deal with the schedule presented to you.  \n\nSo now you’re probably thinking about the lecture I just gave you. What about down time? Like, seriously OP, when am I supposed to even have time to myself? That’s the thing, college is supposed to be amazing, and you have all this down time. And you tell yourself “I just survived high school that went on for 8+ hours a day this is nothing,” but if you tell yourself that then you are falling into a trap. Listen, we all survived high school (or some sort of prior education), and it is unbelievably easy to think that with so much time on your hands, you can do anything you want. And I mean anything.  \n\nYour studies are important; some people put all their time into their academics and all the power to them. Some of them are athletes, and they find themselves struggling to balance academics and athletics, which is also valid. And some of us have managed to figure it all out by managing to keep it up for 32 hours a day and have no problem. No seriously, we all know a person like that. \n\nIn reality, despite college appearing to be an open door to free time, you really need to be careful. Go to your damn classes, eat properly, attend social meetings, study, and then set aside 1 – 3 hours to yourself. This can be in the evening; this can be spread out over the day. Just take some time, listen to music, work out, walk, nap, do something to help clear your mind out. If you don’t, then you are going to go crazy. I would know it, believe me, I have been there and done that.  \n\n \n\n\\*\\*Lastly\\*\\*: relationships. Okay, we are ready, what do we really know about love? If you read this, you’re kidding yourself, we are on reddit y'all. No, I am playing (cries in forever alone). So, you have arrived at college, you’re going to class and see the prettiest or most handsome guy, gal, or pal you’ve ever seen. You are flabbergasted wondering how such an attractive person is in front of you. And, like a dream, they approach you, y’all strike up a conversation, and two months later you are engaged. Listen, I am all for relationships, find your person. However, do not rush into marriage, especially as a freshman. You’re still learning people; you're still learning who you are. The girl you’re seeing? That’s actually the football captain’s sister, and he is an angry linebacker while you’re a 5’9 tight-end. AKA, unless you get to know her, make sure you don’t rush into anything.  \n\nOf course you don’t need me, a redditor, to lecture you. You are your own person. But I just really want you to consider not rushing into anything without knowing the person. I am not saying to not get into a relationship, just make sure you like the person for who they are and not for the thrill of being in a relationship.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\\*\\*Academics\\*\\*: Well well well, you’ve managed to get past housing/dorms. You have your courses set up, class times ready, and a dream to get that 4.0. Woo! Exciting! Here’s how you can get those good grades. I, personally, was a 3.3 student in my undergraduate (B- to A student). So, take my advice with a grain of salt. The general things that will be covered here are: realism, coursework, and so on. \n\n \n\n\\*\\*1\\*\\*. I want that 4.0! How do I do it? Well, hello there! You’re here and you’re in class. You get to your class fifteen minutes early, seeing the rest of the fresh faces who are also attending that class. You enter into the lecture room, take a seat close to the professor but not front row so you don’t get picked on. You do this four or five more times and after the end of the first week you think that you got the hang of it. Well that, my friends, is called the syllabus week.  \n\nYou either have three types of classes: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (each 50 min), Tuesday and Thursday (hour and fifteen minutes), or one day a week for three hours. I personally don’t mind any of these besides the three hour one. Why is that, you may ask. It’s only once a week! How hard can that be? And you will ask yourself that when you are an hour and a half in with a lecture talking about different types of cell mechanics in sunflower seeds which you have no interest in because you’re an English major.  \n\nSo let me be realistic with y’all for a second, you can absolutely get a 4.0. Folks who do put a whole lot of heart and soul into what they do. For me? Once you get to upper-level courses (STEM major), suddenly those easy courses get real hard. You could get a 40 on an exam and be ecstatic because the second highest grade was a 22. It doesn’t matter how hard you study, at times, there are professors that will screw you over. This leads me to my very first tip (one you have likely heard before) which is: rate my professor. \n\nYou’ve heard, your mom has heard it, and remember your 3^(rd) great uncle joe? Yeah, he’s heard of it too. And this website is not just there to show you pretty numbers, when you are scheduling your classes, go to the f\\*ing websites and look at your professors. If they have a 1 star rating with 45 reviews, try to avoid that professor. Think of it was a food service. Do you really want to go to a professor with a 2 star rating with the average commentator saying that the professor puts questions on the test the range from who wrote Romeo and Julliet to how to do chi squared? Yeah, me neither. This leads in my next point and, if you are here, possible the most important thing I am going to say in this entire thread: \n\n\\*\\*MEETING WITH YOUR ADVICE EARLY AND REGISTER AS SOON AS CLASSES COME OUT.\\*\\*\n\nMy god, I can not scream this into the void enough. For me, I went to a smaller school, so I guess it would be easier to get advising appointments in. However, y’all, especially with classes that are lower level (which multiple folks in different majors have to take), you  need to be early with registration. Your advisor will you give you suggestions on classes and give you a schedule which is adequate for your time. It is your responsibility to make sure you have that lined up, with professors you like, and are ready to register (accept the class schedule) the minute it becomes available. I am telling you right now, every single person who can register early will register early. It is going to be another 7am it opens sort of thing (like with dorms), and if you are not there quick enough, you are going to be stuck with the Mr. Smith who is an ex-police officer “resigned” from duty for doing illegal activities and the only way he can get credit time served (a job) is to work at the college teaching you children about literature from the 1800s (he doesn’t even have a degree).  \n\nI mean this whole heartedly when I say do your f\\*cking researching. Your life will be so much easier if you put the effort in and ensure that you are ready to enroll as soon as it becomes available. If you don’t, you will hate yourself. Remember, rate my professor is like yelp for professors. Do you want a professor that I will go out of their way when a class doesn’t perform well on the test to go over questions for extra credit if everyone participates? Or do you want Mr.Smith who is teaching or else his ex-wife will sue him due to a few too many restraining order violations?  \n\n \n\n\\*\\*2\\*\\*. OP how do I even contact my professor? What if I am not doing well in class but they do not have office hours when I need it? My friend, let me tell you a quick story. It was my freshman year, and I was taking anatomy and physiology one. I was doing alright except for the practical(s). By alright I mean I was scraping with a 71 and a dream. I realized that if I dropped to a 70, I would fail that class. It’s my last module in that class and there is a good shot I don’t pass. So, what did I do? Did I A. ignore my problems and focus on studying for the next two weeks straight B. beg my professor for extra credit C. cheat on my exam with answers given from Mary Jane for 100$ in exchange or D. go to the professor and ask what to do? If you answered D, you would be correct. And you know what that professor did? He 1. helped me with some of the content I was not understanding and 2. recommended I go to the tutoring center. \n\nI, someone who had a 3.8 out of high school, suddenly was looking into ... tutoring. What blasphemy was this?! Except, it was not blasphemy. In fact, tutoring saved my grade not just in A&P 1, but it allowed me to understand the rest of the classes I was struggling with. For most of my undergraduate, I would schedule lessons with the tutoring center (twice a week per class I was struggling with), and we would go over details on what I had issues with, how to go about them differently, and why they were answered the way they were. \n\nMy teacher explained to me like this: going to a tutor who has taken the class with that professor before is like getting a cheat sheet for the exam. The tutors have to have maintained at least a 90 in that class within the past three years. All the tutors I went to had notes from those classes, past exam questions, and they could answer questions I had on homework. They didn’t have past exam copies, necessarily, but they were able to answer questions I had that regarded to possible test questions. You guys don’t know how helpful it is to ask a tutor what possible questions will be on the exam, and they explain it to you and then, look at it, those exact questions (with varying amounts) are on the exam!  \n\nThanks for the lecture, OP! But what if I can’t find a tutor in the subject I have? What if my class is upper level or there are no tutors that have the time availability for me? The thing I figured out as I was finishing my bachelor's degree is that you NEED to contact your teachers. Some may of office hours, but there is often the idea that if you can’t reach them during office hours, they won’t be able to get to you at all. Sometimes you might be able to make office hours; yet, if you can’t, you just have to reach out to your professor. Talk to them after class, make an email thread, do whatever you can to establish that you have questions and need help. Ask them if you can come in sometime other than office hours. I promise you that they will say yes, especially with upper-level professors. They are there to help you, and you have to be willing to reach out for that help.  \n\nOne class that I established a tutoring schedule with was with my Spanish professor. I started it in Spanish 2, and when I got to Spanish 4 I was doing relatively okay. However, despite my attempts to learn Spanish, I was still greatly at a disadvantage compared to my classmates. Why? I don’t know, I just sucked at Spanish. So, I reached out to this professor, and we made a tutoring schedule 2 –3 times a week for fifty minutes. We would go over the contents that I was struggling with and then the contents of the next lecture. This gave me a heads up on what we would be talking about that next day so I wouldn’t feel so nervous. We did our lectures entirely in Spanish, and let me tell you, I couldn’t understand a peep of what he said. But, with having the tutoring sessions in English (AND ACTUALLY COMMMUNICATING WITH MY PROFESSOR) I managed to get my first B in Spanish.  \n\nThis is one example. I have also had tutoring in parasitology (amazing professor but difficult class), genetics, A&P 2, and so on. Even now, in my graduate program, I have established connections with professors to ensure that I am doing the best I can to understand the materials. My classes are asynchronous, but I still reach out to my professors when I don’t understand something. We sit down and meet to discuss questions I have. And if you can’t find a time that works, talk to them. Leave an e-mail chain. SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. \n\nIt is best to do ANYTHING than struggle in silence. Professors do not what to see you fail, it’s their job to ensure that you are able to do the best you can. If there is one thing you take away from this post it is this: get tutoring if you don’t understand something, reach out to your professors directly. It is different in big schools, I get that. But the same thing applies to TAs and other tutoring centers, there are sources there to help you, you just have to admit that you need help.  \n\n\\*\\*Note\\*\\*: Y’all have heard the term “Cs get degrees”, and darling, guess what, that is true. Listen people associate with Cs by scraping by, and once you get to genetics and geriatric care, yeah, you’re gonna be a bit nervous and confused. Some folks are great at courses like that, some people study real hard and get those good grades. For folks like me who are average (maybe even a bit dumb) but try hard to get an average grade, good on you. Sometimes we have to realize that just because you got a C does not mean you are any lesser than someone who got higher. Y’all are both important and both passed. Some folks are super smart and work incredibly hard to get those grades, all the power to you guys. Me? Well, I worked incredibly hard and scraped by. It’s okay to not have the highest grade, as long as you are doing what you absolutely can, then all the power to you.  \n\n \n\n\\*\\*3\\*\\*. You wake up at 7am on Wednesday and look at your alarm clock knowing you have to be at lecture from 8 to 10. You dread it, and you can’t help but ponder why you waited to the last second to register and ended up with an 8am five days a week. You decide to skip the class; what’s the worst that happens? Well, some people can afford class. Some professors don’t take attendance. Yet, as you move up class levels and the class sizes get smaller, professors will start taking attendance. You can skip a certain number of classes before failing. Listen, you have your own willpower! It is your choice! Skip those classes!  \n\nNo, please don’t. I am completely serious when I say you need to attend your classes. You miss one class and suddenly you are completely lost. It’s one class, then two, then four, etc. It can fall apart so quickly. I am not saying you can’t skip one or two classes (hell, I have done the same). However, once you realize you are missing too many classes and your grades start to slip, when does it stop? You have to realize that missing classes will lead to consequences. This can be getting worst grades or even being dropped from the class. It is not worth it y’all. This is not something I will settle on; you need to attend your classes. You will regret it, I promise you.  \n\n \n\n\\*\\*4\\*\\*. You’ve seen this little website going around, it is said to make college life much easier. Just a little enter into the search bar and suddenly you have a whole essay or research product in seconds! You submit, surely thinking that it is better than anything you have ever written. You get it back and huh?! A zero! What is this mayhem! You just failed the class, and now you can never show your face to that professor ever again. \n\nYou know what I am talking about folks: chat GPT. Well not just chat GPT but other AI sources as well. Listen, AI can be an absolutely amazing source. But it is not an amazing source for writing essays and projects. I know it can be so tempting to just open that website and click that little button, all your worries \\*poof\\* gone. Suddenly there is the AI checker, no problem, you’ll try a different website that totally gets by the checker. Hahaha, no. You see, unlike the AI checker, your professor actually reads your essay. The AI checker might not detect AI, but your professor sure as hell will be able to smell the bull sh\\*t meter a mile away. Don’t believe me? I have seen students get dropped from classes for during in an AI generated project or essay. Your professors will not be pleased about this, I promise you. It showcases that 1. you don’t value their time and 2. that you don’t know the material (or can’t present that you do).  \n\nThis is not just chat GPT, as stated, there are other websites that offer these services in return for easy essays or projects. Guys, listen, just do your work. No magic AI center can convey understanding like a person. AI genuinely scares me. I know a lot of folks think AI is great, but I believe that there are limits to how good something can be. Once people start using AI to try and make it look like they understand concepts (that they don’t), then suddenly there are grades administered to people who don’t really understand topics. And while you can say “yay, I passed that class because of AI”, you realize that a lot of concepts build off of concepts that you used AI to look up. And, suddenly, AI really does not do a lot for you. \n\nI am not saying all AI is bad, in fact, there are two AI features I use in all my projects. That being scribbr and mybib. You see, one thing you will learn to do (a lot) is cite. You cite sources for EVERYTHING! And you know what I don’t want to do when I have been staring at a paper for the last eight hours and am all finished to realize that my sources are not cited yet? I do not want to f\\*ing cite fifteen sources manually. So, you know what I do? I pop my sources into scribbr or mybib and their AI will find the sites and cite it for you. It is not doing the project for you; it simply cites the site/source provided and gives you an accurate citation. I use these two for anything I needed citing for (MLA, APA, Vancouver, etc.), and it is the only AI I am really thankful for within my academic journey. Mybib and scribbr links will be at the bottom of this document for your availability. They require no sign up or fee. \n\n\\*\\*Note\\*\\*: Citation machine is also a good source! I find it to be a little more of a hassle with the ADs and sometimes not being able to get all the information when it is literally right there. However, it can still be a good way to cite if needed.  \n\n\\*\\*Note 2\\*\\*: You know what is important? Communication. Listen, we are talking about everything; communication is crucial for everything in your life. It starts with college, where it is your turn to take charge of your life. You are given freedom, but you also have to realize that you have responsibilities that come with those freedoms. There is no better time to start working in communication than college. It can be with professors, friends, team mates, room mates, and so on. One thing I have learnt in college is how to speak up for myself. I used to be quiet and very nervous to advocate for my well being. However, once you get to higher education, you realize that your parents, siblings, or Uncle Joe are going to advocate for you. They might for the first few months, but this is the part of your life where you realize your parents can’t be the ones speaking for you. The example I use is making phone calls.  \n\nSomething that is so easy yet so daunting. I remember in 9^(th) grade I had to miss a sports practice, and I had to call my captain but had a full-blown mental breakdown and started sobbing. I then called her (when practice was already over) telling them I would not be able to make it to practice. Yeah, not my finest moment. But now? Yeah, I get nervous to make phone calls. But if you don’t learn how to initiate communication, then it will haunt you for the rest of your life. Only YOU can stop forest fires – no wait, only YOU can initiate communication in order to make your life easier. I am not saying that your parents are to stop from helping in everything. Last month I called my mom because I couldn’t get my sickle cell documentation, and I was so fed up with EVERYTHING. I had spent 200$ on a test/labs when I knew I did not need them. I had waited in an urgent care for two and a half hours, searched through every documentation and email I had, and I STILL could not find the documentation. Calling my mom as a last resort, it took her fifteen minutes to get the documentation from an old pediatrician. It’s okay to have parents help you out, but you have to realize that you need to be the one to initiate communication (most times). Thank you mom, by the way.   \n\n"

    "body": "Okay this is a bit of a rant, but for some reason this Sub Keeps popping up and I read through and just feel like sharing the advice I really wish I had listened to when I was starting out searching.   \n\\-  \nGetting into the best school will not give you the best life. It will not necessarily set you up better for success. It will not necessarily give you a better education or better prepare you to continue on in your career or more school. All of the focus and pressure on the best grades, the best scores, the best schools, obfuscate the most important thing: Finding a school that is what you want. \n\nTailoring yourself for the program you want is not the same thing as finding the right program for you. \n\nAll the adults telling you to find your passion and to explore everything about yourself in college are the ones you should listen to. All those little schools you've never heard have literally hand-select student bodies full of people that fit together, share the same passions and approach to education, and even if it's not the best program in the world, if YOU are passionate, you are working directly with faculty who are ALSO passionate about the subject and teaching about it, and you are going to be invited to have access in a way you will fight for the entire time at a big school. In college, you will sign up for the most exciting course you can think of and hate it. You will sign up for a quick throwaway course and suddenly find all of your goals will change. \n\nThis isn't to say don't go for the big fish, or reach for a crazy dream. I absolutely had dream schools. However, I also failed out of schools I should have loved because I chose for bad reasons. After years of trying to do it everyone else's way, I finally ended up at a school that barely had a semblance of my field - I was literally one of 6 majors and I was the only person in my specific field going back like 5 years. But I had amazing faculty. I got pushed and focused on in ways that far surpassed the support I saw at bigger schools. I wasn't working with famous professors or building anything that was seen outside my own little corner of the universe. But I was building, I was loving it, and I was being given every bit of encouragement and support the entire time. \n\nLater, I took all of that experience and landed a spot in an amazing art school that was literally a reach beyond reaching. (I didn't even apply the first year I looked, it felt so out of reach). There I got pushed and encouraged out of my field finally landed a spot in literally the best program in the world in another field. And it was one of the biggest mistakes and worst years of my life. It was fucking terrible. I reached for a program I wanted to fit into instead of finding a program that was right for me.  I can say full stop that the reason I quit pursuing a Doctorate was because of that program. \n\nAll of this is to say don't proselytize yourself to fit a school. Find a school that is excited to show you what it will do for you. A school that invites you to be an individual, to be imperfect, and a school that cares about what you want to do tomorrow. Push yourself into spaces that are being built for you. \n\nMaybe that's an Ivy. Maybe 7 Sisters. Maybe it's the 600-person school no one's heard of. There's a lot of ways to educate yourself. In my experience, the \"better\" schools never opened any doors the other schools already weren't.\n\nYou're going to pay tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands for this education AND for the experience you have. Make it the one YOU want, and find a school that's willing to step up and show you how they're excited to make that happen for you."

Like, I have sleeping issues and burnout from punching the gas all of high school that I am still struggling to get under control now. I have an autoimmune disease although this was due to other factors as well. I thought that a prestigious university was the absolute golden ticket of life, and I think it was a combination of my social class and societal programming that created that. I just wanted to succeed at whatever cost. \n\nWhat became clear especially towards the end of college is that a prestigious degree DOES NOT determine your success in life. I have watched several of my peers go off and do internships and start their careers and their workplaces are infiltrated by graduates of all different colleges. I was shocked to learn this because I was naive and idealistic and thought that prestigious degrees will go and only work at prestigious companies, and though that happens to a select few, honestly most of my friends ended up at regular jobs working with regular people. \n\nI will say, if you are going into a purely academic field, the 'better' degree will help you out. But you can also most likely accomplish the same thing from a state school. Like I honestly is not a huge deal. Employers mainly care about your experience and could care less about what you majored in most of the time. The facade of prestigious universities is a mostly a marketing strategy to get you to lay down bank to go to one of these schools, unfortunately. \n\nThat being said, I love my school and had a blast, but please, do not kill yourself over this. It really does not matter in the grand scheme of life and you will end up where you want to go no matter what school you went to 9 times out of 10. \n\n"

    "body": "So, I just finished my applications, and the whole process was a bit of a trainwreck for me (I didn’t decide which major or schools to apply to until a month before the first deadline, crammed most of my essays the week before the deadline, and stressed about applying to way more schools than I actually needed to). These are mostly just things that I really wish I knew before applying to schools that would have made my application season go a lot smoother: these things won’t necessarily be useful for everyone's situation, but can hopefully help some incoming high school seniors/college applicants. Sorry that this is long, but hopefully you'll find it to be worth the read!\n\n1. START EARLY - Finishing at the minimum a college list, major selection, and a draft of your common app essay (plus PIQ drafts if you're applying to UCs) by the end of the summer will make your fall so much easier and more enjoyable. I know you probably feel so burnt out right now, but you will be SO much more burnt out in the fall if you don’t start in the summer when you don’t also have homework, and you only need to devote an hour a week. Also, applying to colleges EA (Early Action) if possible can increase your chances of being admitted, so starting in the summer can help you to get a head start on those applications.\n\n2. DON’T APPLY TO 20+ SCHOOLs - This is KEY to preventing stress and burnout during your senior year. Applying to a billion schools isn’t going to do anything for you, it will just create problems, trust me. (Read numbers 3&4 to prevent this)\n\n3.START WITH SAFETY SCHOOLS - Beginning your college search by picking from just safety schools narrows down the options, and helps you to find some schools that you can definitely go to. Pick 1-3 solid safety schools that you actually want to go to, then look at more selective schools and only pick schools you’d rather go to than your safety schools (Helps to direct and narrow down college search and avoid spending time applying to colleges you’ll immediately cross off your list). I researched most of my schools on Niche btw.\n\n4.HAVE CRITERIA - If there is something you want in a college, even if it is silly, only apply to colleges that have that thing, because even if you get into other good colleges, you will likely end up choosing whichever college with that thing. Narrow it down now so you don’t spend a bunch of time and pay a bunch of money applying to schools you don’t want, even if the reason you don’t want to go to them is “dumb”. (Note: This is just a method for narrowing down an overpopulated list, not every college that you apply to has to have absolutely everything you want). For instance, I liked large colleges that had pretty campuses and rock walls in their gym, so when it came between my top three colleges I chose the one that was large, pretty and had a rock wall in the gym (Note: these were not my only determining factors, I thought it through a lot more thoroughly than that, but they definitely played a part in my final decision, even if they were “silly”). Trust your gut about what you want in a school, and don’t apply to a school you wouldn't go to, even if it seems nice on the surface - it can be a good school but not the right school for you, and that's ok!\n\n5. DON’T APPLY TO SCHOOLS JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ESSAYS - I applied to multiple schools that didn’t have essays because they didn’t require any work, but honestly I didn’t want to go to them, and they went right off my list. Ask yourself if you would still apply to each school if it required extra essays, and if the answer is not yes, don’t apply. (Especially for CSUs and UCs, if you would only actually go to one or two, DO NOT apply to five just to justify the time you spent on the app)\n\n6. WRITING YOUR COLLEGE ESSAYS - Most college essays need two things: an event and a value. For a value, think of an important moral to you, or search positive character traits if you need an idea. Your event can be anything that happened (or affected your life) in high school. In your essay, begin with a hook, explain your event, then link that event to how you developed/grew in your value, and finish by explaining how you applied it in high school and how you plan to apply it in college and beyond. Universities don’t want to just know about things that happened to you, they want to know about you as a person. Note: if you are stuck on the first draft of your essays, try “the most dangerous writing app”, the threat of deletion helps me prevent second-guessing my decisions and keeps me going. The fast pace can also help to make your essays sound more authentic. Note: this is mostly good for word vomiting and will need serious revising later.\n\n7. MAJOR - This decision is deeply personal and unfortunately, no one is able to tell you exactly how to make it. For me, I found it best to look at the classes I did well in. I found that my interests didn’t much equate to a major because I like singing and crafts, but was not planning to be a music/art major (I liked them, but just to unwind and have fun, not as a profession). I was a pretty well rounded student, but decided to ultimately do engineering since STEM pays more, and ended with BME (biomedical engineering) because I always liked the idea of being in a health-care related field to help people but didn’t want to be a doctor because of the length of med school. It’s also very interdisciplinary, which I liked as someone who didn’t like the constrictiveness of college majors. Another thing that you can do if you are unsure is look at UIUC’s interest paths which give you major ideas for each Holland type (I didn’t find the actual Holland type quiz that useful though), and they can give you some ideas for potential majors based on your interests/strengths/personality.\n\n8. DON’T THINK TOO HARD - I’m very much an over thinker, and when it came to making a college list on my own, for each college I had to be SURE I’d want to go there before I even put it on my list. And when it came to picking a major, I was watching day in the life videos and planning my entire career path. Ultimately, both of these led me to stall my decisions. It’s good to be prepared and have a plan, but none of this is permanent: you can transfer majors, and you can transfer schools. Don’t let making a perfect decision stop you from making a good decision. For most colleges I applied to and later toured, even those I didn't do extensive research on, I didn’t find anything that was a deal breaker, so if you like a college on the surface, chances are it’ll be just fine when you go to see it in person and learn more about it. I applied under multiple majors: the only one I regretted was the one I only applied to because of some very strong encouragement from my parents (CS), but the one I chose (also with some help from my parents in addition to my own interest)), my interest only grew in. Major switches are also relatively easy and common to do if you ultimately regret your major.\n\n9. ORGANIZATION - Organize your to-dos for each of your college applications and get somewhere to put your results and usernames/passwords for admitted student accounts when colleges send those out. I used a table on notion for this, and it worked quite well! Other ideas include a google sheet, google doc, or note on the notes app. Put all of your college essays on one document or in one google drive. Also, use a planner or calendar app to schedule your time to work and submit on applications, especially if you end up ignoring my advice and doing many. Set realistic deadlines and do not cram your essays.\n\nThanks for reading this and I hope you enjoyed and found this helpful! As I have not started college yet, I will update more after seeing how I enjoy college/major selection (BME at CU Boulder). Good luck with college applications, and feel free to ask any questions you may have!"

    "body": "A lot of you are getting some news today or tomorrow about EA or ED applications. I know some of you are getting rejections — that sucks.\n\nBut some of you are getting deferred, and I'm seeing tons of questions asking about it. Let's cover a few of the most frequently-asked questions:\n\n**1. If I'm deferred, what should I do now?**\n\n(a) If you're deferred, make sure to send a mid-year school report in when it's available in January or February. This is to keep the school updated on your grades and enrollment.\n\n(b) If you've had any significant updates to your application, you can submit an update via the school's application update form / applicant portal. However, only do this if it's a really big change! We're talking major awards, major new ECs (like you've just gotten a national position), major competitions won. Not small updates. Not second-guessing what you put for your tenth EC on your Activities List. Just really big stuff.\n\n**2. What are my chances of admission after being deferred?**\n\nColleges don't like to give statistics on this, so it's hard to pin down exactly. \n\nSome colleges are known for deferring tons of students, then later rejecting them in the spring (Princeton, Harvard, MIT, Brown). Other colleges use deferral more sparingly (Northwestern, Stanford, Penn). Yale and Cornell are around the middle.\n\nIf you've been deferred, you still have a real chance of being admitted in the spring. E.g. for the Penn class of 2026, 9.5% of deferred students were admitted in the spring, compared to the 6.5% acceptance rate overall.\n\nIn the words of the Yale AOs, \"deferral means we see you as a compelling candidate for Yale, and we want to consider in our broader regular decision pool.\"\n\nDeferral means that they liked your application enough that they still want to option of selecting you — but you weren't such a strong applicant that they were willing to commit a spot in the class to you before they see the RD applicant pool. I'd take it as a good sign, though obviously not as nice as a straight acceptance.\n\n**3. Does being deferred change anything about my RD applications? Should I do ED II?**\n\nHopefully you weren't waiting to hear back about your EA or ED decisions before starting on your RD apps.\n\nA deferral is *not* admission, and you should still keep working hard on your RD apps. If you were rejected, it might be an indication that you should revisit your Personal Statement or the other main parts of your application. If you were deferred, I'd take it as a sign that you were on the right track with your application. Just put in a lot of effort to all of the supplemental essays for January.\n\nFor schools like UChicago, students who applied EA and were deferred have the option to convert their app to ED II. If UChicago is your top choice, go for it — your chances do improve significantly with ED II.\n\nIf you're now considering doing ED II to another school... remember, any ED app is binding. Don't apply ED II to a second school if you'd be crushed in the event that you ultimately *were* admitted to your EA or ED I school. Only apply ED II to a school where you'd accept their offer without hesitation.\n\n  \nGood luck!"

And truly, no one understands unless if they are going through this process; specifcally becoming a nursing major.\n\nThe biggest piece of advice I can give is go to a school/attend a program that has direct entry. Many schools may offer a nursing major, but most would require you to apply later in the year. This isn't an optimal thing as acceptance rates/competiveness are insane. Most who don't do direct entry will not become nurses. It's simply fact.\n\nI applied to over 20 schools all for nursing. From Emory to Florida Atlantic, Clemson University to University of Vermont, I needed to cast my net as wide as possible since nursing acceptance rates are notouriusly low. I got into all besides 3. Most gave me money. (Probably because I'm a boy and they need male nurses.) I was in the top 10% of my class and had a 4.4 GPA. My essays and reqs were stellar.\n\nI ultimatley decided on attending Indiana University (IU) for nursing. Not only is this program ranked amoung the T20 best for nursing, and 10th amoung public schools, but it offered me a direct entry option. (36 DA spots, other 80 are regular. I can't tell you how lucky I was to receive a spot.) Even gaining entry to the program as a pre-nursing major is insane, (harder than our renowned business school, Kelly).\n\nIt's also important to consider how far clinicals will be, too. IU is literally down the hall as the nursing program is in the hopsital on campus. (Again, a rariety.) A school like Clemson, for instance, is upwards of 30 mins for the NEAREST clinical. This matters, espcially if transportation is a challenge.\n\nDA (direct entry) is your go-to-option.\n\nA couple that offer DA off the top of my head are:\n\nUMich\n\nIU (Highly selective)\n\nClemson\n\nFAU (Selective)\n\nUSF (Selective)\n\nUDel\n\nOSU (Highly Selective)\n\nUTK\n\nUT-Austin\n\nUPenn (Stress pot lol)\n\nElon\n\nUVermont\n\nWest Virginia\n\nUVA\n\nRutgers (I think)\n\nUofSouth Carolina (Highly Selective)\n\nOthers that I can't think of in the time being.\n\n\\*NOTE\\* Selective means that they primarily offer pre-nursing but some spots are open for Direct entry.\n\nI wish you nothing but sucess amoung your college journey. Enjoy this time as it passes fast. And remember: getting into ANY program for nursing is almost as competive as ivy institutions."

    "body": "Yay you! You all made it through the early rounds, including the UC apps for those who applied to those schools. So, so, so many high fives to all of you!!! And many of you have even gotten some awesome acceptance letters so far -- more high fives!\n\nSo what now?\n\nHere are a few reminders to get you through the next few weeks:\n\n1. **Hold onto Your Hearts:** As you hear back from early applications over the next few weeks, do some emotional planning. Understand that you have done your absolute best to put forth the strongest application that's an amazing reflection of the very best you on your very best day. You’ve done that, I know, because I’ve read many of your essays and seen your applications. Now, the decisions are out of your control, so I want you to hope for the best but plan for the worst. Know that for the highly, highly selective colleges many of you’ve applied to, there are just too many amazing yous to fit into the tiny teacup of colleges, so there will be some disappointments. Know this, too: if the decision doesn’t go your way, it is in no way a reflection of you, your potential, or who you are. You are far more than your college applications, and whatever school is smart enough to accept you will be a very lucky school. You can read more about this in my [Emotional Planning post here](https://open.substack.com/pub/admissionsmom/p/its-time-for-some-emotional-planning-class-of-2025) and in my [post about why a little stress just might be good for you -- and trees.](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/college-admissions-decisions-wind)\n2. **Log into Your Portals:** Continue logging into your portals and checking to see if your colleges need anything at all from you. Provide any info colleges say they still need. Know that it can take up to a week for materials to be submitted. Here’s my portal mantra: Check your portals regularly, but not obsessively :)\n3. **Update Naviance/Your School Counselor:** Make sure you’ve checked that you’ve applied to all the schools where you’ve applied on Naviance or Scoir or Cialfo or Maia or whatever system your school uses, or email your school counselor with your list of the schools where you’ve applied. Make sure your school counselor has everything they need from you.\n4. **Check-in with your Recommenders:** Send them a brief email to let them know you’ve applied to your regular decision schools as you complete those apps, and how excited you are, and how much you appreciate their help on this journey. Be sure to send them a handwritten thank-you note at some point soon.\n5. **Check for Interview Info:** As you apply to your regular decision schools, be sure to keep checking for interview information. Do the interview. You can find my post with more information about the [interview here.](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/2024-step-by-step-guide-to-interviews) Be sure to read it and fill your invisible backpack with your stories.\n6. **Send Test Scores:** If you haven’t yet submitted test scores for your regular decision schools (if you are submitting test scores) and the colleges require official scores, do so now. Don’t wait and give yourself that stress.\n7. **Keep Up with your Supplemental Essays for your RD Schools:** Stay on task and make a plan to get those essays done and ready to go -- even if you've applied ED and you're waiting to hear back. Get organized and sort your essays into groups like Why Major, Why College, Identity, Future Plans, Greatest Challenge -- so that it's easier for you to reduce, reuse, and recycle. You can read more about supplemental essays in my post from earlier in the fall.\n8. **You Might Be Deferred:** If that happens, write a Letter of Continued Interest (LOCI), unless the college specifically says not to. I suggest submitting them around the second week of January after the admissions offices have gotten back and settled in -- but be sure to read and follow any specific instructions and deadlines they give you. I’ll be posting about your LOCI and what to do if you’re deferred later, but you can read more about this in [my post from last year.](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/if-you-were-deferred-its-time-to)\n9. **This is your chance:** This is your time to learn how strong you are and learn more about colleges and what you want for yourself. This isn’t an ending. It’s a beginning.\n10. **Take care of yourselves:** Stay healthy and well during the holidays and those early days of 2024. I know these are stressful times in many ways beyond college admissions, which makes it even more important to take care of yourself and take time to breathe, exercise, get outside, and spend time with family and friends.\n\nPlease keep me updated as you hear back from colleges. I’m ready to celebrate and commiserate, whatever the case may be. I'm here for you.\n\nXOXOXO AdmissionsMom"

    "body": "Senior SCS student here, going to try to combat some of the strangely inaccurate information about CMU and specifically SCS for those considering applying. Having said that, this is my and my friends experience, everyone is different.  \nLet's start with an FAQ  \nHow do you get into SCS?  \nAnyone who says they know the answer to this is lying. I don't. I have never met a SCS student who knew why they got in. SCS seems to value students with fundamentally strong math skills. It definitely helps in classes. They also seem to like students who are different (activities, interests, backgrounds) and have shown interest in something. My best advice is to not take advice from A2C, CC, or any online forum claiming to know what you should do to be admitted. And...I have never met an SCS student who used an admission counselor or service. Definitely could be some selection bias, but that's my experience. Just be honest and convey why you want to go here..and \"because it is highly rated\" is not a reason. Most students here didn't win competitions (or even enter them), didn't do internships or research, and come from all different types of HS.  \nShould I send in my SAT if the score is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?  \nNo idea. I would send in if it is 1550 (780 math) or above for sure, and probably near there is good but no one knows and I could be very wrong. Lots of people got in without standardized tests but it seems SCS is wanting them more now and they are supposed to be mandatory next year.  \nIs it hard?  \nI'm always confused on this question. CMU is considered by many people to be one (if not the :)) top CS program in the world. Why would anyone think it would be easy? There is not a \"Big 4\" program that is easy. I don't think there is a T20 CS program that is easy. However, my stats were average for SCS and I have done extremely well in my classes, while maintaining an enjoyable social life. The professors are excellent, the TA's are amazing, and I think the curriculum is unrivaled. Classes are organized well and learning is prioritized. Projects are challenging, but mostly interesting and rewarding. I hear stories, many on this sub, about the old days when students were flogged by professors, but this changed years ago apparently. Almost every student I know here loves being here.  \nIs it cutthroat?  \nNo. You will often get more help from your friends, or even random people you meet in OH, than from profs and TAs. No one has trouble finding jobs, so they don't feel like it is a competition. People generally love learning so it makes classes challenging but the profs, TAs and support system is second to none. Almost no one transfers out of SCS because they can't handle the academics. I actually don't know anyone, but I don't know everyone. There are some dicks with low self esteem who need to brag but these are rare exceptions and are easily avoided.  \nAre there options within SCS?  \nThere are 5 majors and 11 concentrations in SCS. You have to have a minor or concentration in something, but it doesn't have to be CS related. CMU loves collaboration and will usually let you combine studies with any other program. This means more than math, physics, or the other common ones. Art, music, business, philosophy, public policy, whatever. You can probably do it.  \nDo you have any time outside of class?  \nYes, this is simple math. Average hours per week for classes and studying is around 50-55, or 6.5-7 hours a day. You can sleep 8 hours a night and still have 8 hours a day to do whatever you want. I like to work more during the week and take off friday and saturday but you choose your own schedule.  \nAre there things to do outside of class?  \nCMU is in an area known as Oakland, which has 50000+ students between the 3 colleges and all the medical and graduate programs. There are tons of restaurants, bars, some clubs, and everything a college student needs. It's also on a major bus route that goes downtown to theaters, museums, sporting events, etc, or to malls, movie theaters, etc. CMU has a huge park on one side of the campus for disc golf, regular golf, biking, running, or whatever. Pittsburgh also has tons of festivals and outdoor activities. Plus you get to go to all the CMU drama and music performances. If you cannot find fun things to do, you aren't trying. There are people who probably don't go out at all colleges but it is their choice. There are also hundreds of clubs on campus for pretty much any activity you could want. Lastly, you can find drugs and alcohol at CMU (and Pitt) but I don't think it dominates the culture as much as at some schools. For my friends and me, it is not really our thing, but it's around if you want. We generally like to eat, hang out, play games, go to festivals and events, etc.  \nHow's the weather?  \nPittsburgh has more days with rain than the average. However, most of the time you don't even notice it. 3 drops of rain count as a rain day. Most students don't carry raincoats or umbrellas since it isn't worth it even on a rain day. I've been to amusement parks, played disc golf, biked, and gone to festivals on \"rain days\" and it didn't slow us down. Winters are pretty mild compared with places like Chicago or anywhere in the northeast. It snows but usually is gone within a day or two. If you need every day to be sunny or you enjoy really hot or really cold weather, you probably should go somewhere else.  \nHow's the food?  \nI am not aware of a college that has excellent food, but I have no issues with CMU food. There is no cafeteria, instead there are small food places scattered around campus serving a wide variety of food. There are also ?50 restaurants within a 5 minute walk or bus ride from campus if you want that instead.  \nWho should apply?  \nCMU is not for everyone...no college is. Don't apply to any school solely because of it's reputation. You probably won't be accepted because colleges like students who want to be there for more than the reputation. Most people I know here love learning, love to geek out, and enjoy being around people who feel similarly. They still enjoy activities outside of academics but weekend football games and massive parties are not the most popular social activities. Think more smaller groups of friends hanging out doing something together.  \nWhat questions do you have?"

    "body": "A lot of my students are beginning to hear back from summer programs they are considering. Some students are lucky enough to have multiple options to choose from, and others might have one option but are deciding if the [cost and time are worth it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vud4dq/are_precollege_programs_a_waste_of_money/).\n\nHere’s what I want you to know:\n\nAdmissions is about *storytelling*.\n\nAttending a summer program in and of itself will not have a major impact on your admission outcome. But remember, it doesn’t exist simply as a line in your activities section. It may provide material for an admissions essay down the road, perhaps about an academic interest, teamwork, or a challenge.\n\nFor example, imagine answering the UC prompt #6 (which, btw, I recommend you answer):\n\n***6. Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.***\n\nYou might respond with an essay with a storyline like this:\n\nI always enjoyed science classes, but didn’t understand the application/ that changed when I took AP Biology and did \\_\\_\\_ lab and learned \\_\\_\\_/ I had to learn more, so I attended \\_\\_\\_\\_ summer program where I was able to apply \\_\\_\\_ to \\_\\_\\_ and was surprised to learn \\_\\_\\_/ these experiences together have solidified my interest in applying \\_\\_\\_ principles of biology to a pre-medical track in college/ I’m particularly interested in continuing my investigation of \\_\\_\\_ in college.\n\nSo, the program becomes part of your story as you make a case for admission.\n\nIt isn’t about achieving admission to a program and showing it off like a trophy, it’s about describing who you are as a learner/student/researcher/interesting person.\n\nBecause ultimately, admissions, and highly-selective admission in particular, is about *storytelling*. That is how admission offices make a subjective decision about who to admit between equally amazing and academically qualified students.\n\nSo, one way to think about your summer is to think about how any program, activity, job, volunteer position etc. would contribute to your story. It is also important to remember that this is only one perspective you need to consider. Cost, time, interest, fun, travel, family needs—there are many other perspectives besides admission that matter a lot too.\n\nGood luck out there ✌️"

Both have pretty low post-II acceptance rates and there is still a good chance I'll turn up empty-handed in March, so I'm looking for advice on how to get more IIs next cycle if I need to reapply.\n\n**Basic Info:** 3.95 cGPA, 3.95 BCPM GPA, 524 MCAT (131/130/132/131), 22M E Asian (rip), BioE major, IL resident, attending T20 undergrad\n\n**ECs:** Pretty mid and unbalanced.\n\n* 1500 hours research (no pubs or productivity),\n* 120 hours hospital vol (generic \"bring patients iced water\" type stuff),\n* 80 hours nonclinical vol (one org over the course of 3 years, rose thru the ranks to a high-rank Eboard position),\n* 500 hours cultural org (lower-ranking E board member),\n* 100 hours shadowing (3 specialties and 3 different docs).\n* No talents or X-factor. I play piano but mostly for my church, play tennis and lift weights casually.\n\n**School List:** All T30s except for UCLA and UTSW, four T50s (all OOS publics), my state school (T100)\n\n**Where I think I went wrong:**\n\n* My Asian immigrant parents were overconfident with my high MCAT score and GPA and said I can apply to top schools even though I wasn't qualified, which is why my school list was so top-heavy\n* I didn't know that you needed hundreds of hours of hospital volunteering and community service to be competitive for even lower-ranked schools\n* My research had a lot of hours but not much to show for it\n* My narrative was not very clear in my PS. I had a lot of different reasons for being interested in medicine but none of them stood out as an overarching theme.\n* I didn't start checking out this sub until very late and was rather uneducated/uninformed about the competitiveness of the modern day admissions process\n\n**Things that I can't change but probably still hurt me regardless:**\n\n* **EDIT: Forgot to mention that I got COVID during July when all the secondaries were flooding my inbox. I was so sick and couldn't write so I took over a month to write most of my secondaries rather than the recommended two weeks.**\n* My state school has an average MCAT of like 512 and is more geared to producing physicians who will serve my home state, and doesn't place much emphasis on research. Because of my high stats and going to a \"prestigious\" undergrad school on the East Coast instead of my state flagship school, they probably thought I didn't have much of a desire to practice in my home state. It feels really unfair that they would assume such a thing because it's completely untrue.\n* The PIs I worked with said they wouldn't write LORs because I wasn't there long enough (which is rich coming from them because they're the ones who made me leave their labs after a year)\n* Because I'm an ordinary middle-class Asian guy with no special talents/X factors or life stories, adcoms just don't see me as a very interesting or compelling person\n* I'm only 22 and adcoms probably see me as immature especially because I'm a guy\n\n**My plan for redemption:**\n\n* Apply for jobs doing research where the PI will actually have to support me and mentor me instead of disposing of me like they usually do with undergrads\n* If I can't get a research job, do a MA cert course online and search for clinics that are hiring\n* Make a new school list, remove Harvard and Stanford, add more schools in the T40-70 range\n* I've gotten my hospital volunteer hours up to 200 now but I find it so mind-numbingly boring that I'll probably focus more on nonclinical volunteering instead, because I would rather get out into the community and work with people there\n* Find a community charity org that I enjoy working with and get like 200-300 hours there\n* Continue shadowing doctors, check out more specialties\n* Ideally I want to get accepted after one gap year. If I take two gap years my MCAT will expire at about half the schools on my list, and there's no way I can top a 524 on the second attempt because I would be out of school and washed AF\n\nDoes anyone else have any critiques or advice about this plan? Any other insights about why I might have not gotten more interviews? I would appreciate everyone's input.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Can I improve my application by this spring or do I need to take two gap years (and retake the MCAT)? Because I feel like my application is deficient in so many different ways and a year is not enough to address these issues\n* What would be some good schools to add that are outside the T30s and would be fine with a research-heavy applicant? Should I also apply DO?"

Although I’m not fully sure what I want to pursue, I'm considering a career in finance (though both schools are not targets), accounting, or becoming an actuary. I was also considering a double major (CS at UCI and Math-CS at UCSD), as many jobs today require coding. I intend to attend grad school.\n\nUCSD\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Seen as the 3rd best UC- only behind Berkeley and LA. In SoCal, most people would think I'm crazy to consider UCI over UCSD. Might open more doors in the future especially for tech.\n\n\\- It's well rounded, which is probably a big plus because I'm not certain what to do.\n\n\\- Very easy to switch into non-selective majors (literal drop-down menu)\n\n\\- Math-CS is an option as a second major (although I'm not sure if this is better than UCI's pure CS program). UCSD is well known for their CS program, not sure about Math-CS\n\nCons:\n\n\\-  Ucsd's business Econ is more new, and it is lacking in finance related internships due to its location\n\n\\-  less big 4 opportunities from what I’ve heard\n\n\\- Competitive environment (tons of hard working grinders chasing a few spots)\n\n\\- Stereotype that it's \"socially dead\"\n\n\\- Was accepted into Revelle which is the worst college w/ bad GE's and dorms\n\nUCI\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Better business Econ program than ucsd for big 4 placements and internships\n\n\\- Closer to home (1 hr vs 2 hr 30 mins), can come home to LA on the weekends if I need\n\n\\- Has a good CS program, (though not as good as UCSD's pure CS program, not sure about UCSD's Math-CS program)\n\n\\- I like Irvine because it's similar to the suburb I live in\n\n\\- Would probably fit in with the type of ppl who go there (Asian, plays Val/League/OW2/shooters)\n\n\\- Probably easier to get good grades for grad school\n\nCons:\n\n\\- Generally ranked lower than UCSD for other majors that are not business\n\n\\- UCSD is seen as quite a bit more prestigious in SoCal\n\nUnsure/Questions:\n\n\\- Does where you get your undergrad matter if you are going into CS, or do you just have to be good at your craft?\n\n\\- For grad school, will admissions give preference to UCSD because it is more rigorous (like bumping up the applicant's GPA a bit more compared to Irvine)?\n\n\\- Is there anything going to UCSD would give me that going to Irvine can't?\n\n\\- UCSD has a higher starting median salary, but I don't know if that's an unfair comparison."

    "body": "Hey everyone. Would anyone mind giving me pointers on my first cold email for a PhD visit?\n\nFor context, I have already contacted the departments advisors and have a formal tour set up, but was advised to send out some personal emails to labs I am interested in.\n\nThanks!\n\n\\----\n\nDear Dr. \\[BLANK\\],\n\nMy name is \\[BLANK\\], and I'm a rising senior at \\[UNIVERSITY NAME\\] dual majoring in Environmental Science and Biology. I will be visiting \\[CITY\\] during the second week of August (5th–12th), and I’m reaching out to introduce myself and express my strong interest in your lab’s research.\n\nOver the last two years, I have grown increasingly drawn to plant science, especially the mechanisms by which plants evolve new traits through changes in regulation. I have been lucky throughout my college career to be a part of numerous research groups with plant science in mind, which have drawn my curiosity toward studying how developmental factors can be adapted to improve growth and resilience in plants—more specifically, crops.\n\nMy interest in pursuing a PhD was solidified during the 2024 REU program at \\[RESEARCH INSTITUTION\\], where I worked under Dr. \\[BLANK\\]. That summer opened my eyes to the power of plant genetics to solve real-world challenges. I helped lead a project exploring how select plant species could be used to sequester automotive carbon along highways—a proposal now being piloted across stretches of highway in \\[STATE 1\\] and \\[STATE 2\\] this very summer. That experience grounded my belief that plant research, when done with intention, has the capacity to directly improve lives.\n\nSince then, I’ve grown particularly interested in how regulatory pathways evolve and can be redirected toward sustainability goals, such as improving nitrogen efficiency in plants. During my time at \\[RESEARCH INSTITUTION\\], I stumbled upon the then-recent discovery of a nitrogen-fixing organelle, *Braarudosphaera bigelowii*, which has since engrossed my curiosity in thinking about how we might one day integrate such functions into terrestrial plants. That curiosity has led me to your lab.\n\nIn preparation for further research, I have involved myself in as many opportunities as I have been able to get my hands on—not only to better educate myself, but also to gain the technical expertise necessary to make said innovation a reality. I have multi-year experience in learning model architecture, particularly with convolutional neural networks, and am well versed in greenhouse management, field work, and plant-based experimental design. I am proficient in data science tools such as Python, ArcGIS, R, and MATLAB. Where I am lacking, such as in more thorough wet lab experience, I am hoping to find in a PhD program post-graduation.\n\nI realize I am quite early in the stages of refining my research focus, but am planning to apply to PhD programs in Fall 2026 and am very interested in how your lab might align with my long-term goals. I’d be very grateful for any chance to briefly visit the lab or connect with you. As to not overwhelm this already lengthy email, I am happy to send a CV per request.\n\nThank you very much, Dr. \\[BLANK\\], for your time and consideration.\n\nAll the best, \\[BLANK\\]\n\n"

    "body": "A brutally honest look at selective college admissions from someone admitted to HYPSM, with an AO parent. \n\n\n\nPlease consider that these are my own thoughts throughout the process, this is the advice I would have wanted coming into my freshmen year, even if it has not the most ethical or morally sound ideas. \n\n\n\n1. The best extracurriculars, honors, even jobs, are not advertised. Advertising = they want something from you = less value to you. The best of these are found from word of mouth, personal research, or best yet, for activities - you create these opportunities yourself. Find the most optimal opportunities for yourself in any given scenario in life - it is best for you, and you matter the most, after all. \n\n\n\n1. Sorry if this point comes off as a bit machiavellian. In my opinion, cheating makes LOGICAL sense - Take the probability of getting away with it and multiply by the possible reward. Take the probability of getting caught and multiply by the possible consequences (pretty high for college applications, but what’s the chance they’re going to find out that you added an extra hour to one of your activities?). Subtract the second from the first. Is it positive?\n\n\n\n1. Admissions officers only see a superficial view of you. Why not manipulate, mold it into a perfect, compelling narrative? “The open-source coding genius”, “The PhD-level biochem research whiz,” etc. These AOs present your file to the committee like a lawyer making a case for your client. Passionate or not, give them the ability to say flashy things about you and woo the others.\n\n\n\n1. Genuinity can be faked. I did this, so did others. That Stanford ‘29 student? Applied and accepted for biology crafting a somber story about his mother’s death to thyroid cancer and how it inspired him to pursue related research with a professor at UVA. Immediately switched to CS after acceptance. To these top tier colleges where you can switch your majors willy-nilly, apply to what gives you the best shot, not what you’re most interested in. \n\n\n\n1. Extracurriculars and numbers shouldn’t be faked, but they can certainly be cheesed. Have some “founder” extracurriculars where you show initiative in your community, but don’t have too many or it can become obvious you’re cheesing it. If you’re struggling to gain positions the natural way, create a club/nonprofit and only call yourself president. More importantly, quantify your impact within these roles: countries reached, dollars fundraised, chapters created, kids impacted. Embrace the technicalities as you embellish and create the perfect application for your reader. \n\n \n\n1. Have some real extracurriculars. Two of your teachers will be writing you a letter of recommendation. Ideally, both of them would know you as a strong “intellectual mind” in the class, but also through an activity outside of the class. That way, they can attest to your leadership as well. When your applications are read at a college with the rest of your competitors in your high school and all of you have the same teacher for a LOR, this will help you stand out.\n\n\n\n1. Grades are a baseline. If you don’t have a near-perfect GPA, or even a badly-placed B on your transcript (i.e., a B in second semester junior year AP CSA when applying CS), you are going to have a tough time applying to T20s\n\n\n\n1. Don’t be typical. When you’re the 28th file the AO is speedreading of the day, you need to do, write, and sometimes record things that interest them. Why should they choose to argue your case in committee when they can choose the Didgeridoo YoungArts winner, or the NeurIPS conference speaker who was cited by OpenAI? Math club president is just another walk in the park for them. \n\n\n\n1. There is a near-certain formula to getting accepted to any college. Doing stuff for fun and “applying sideways” is dumb. Me doing things for the fun of it would be playing valorant all-day after school. These colleges have wants in mind when admitting students, more often than not they don’t align to yours. The most certain of these formulas are often out of reach; IMO Gold + perfect stats + a light sprinkle of “genuinity” and community service is the way. For the vast majority of people, try for AIME and potentially USAMO, USABO semifinalist, try for a publication with an established lab, or something else. The selective nature of these olympiads mean they will never come off as stereotypical to an adcom. USACO’s prestige is diminishing with some admissions offices like that of MIT (from what I’ve heard, take with a grain of salt) due to AI. If you feel it will still help your narrative but you don’t want to do it for the enjoyment of it, don’t beat the cheaters, join ‘em - just smartly.\n\n\n\n1.  Summer programs can be helpful, but they aren’t a requirement. I never attended a summer program; I simply took community college classes and did research at the local university. However, names like SSP carry a lot of weight to these colleges, even if you do the bare minimum and goof around the rest. \n\n\n\n1. Why do people think self studying APs makes you look pretentious to colleges? Think about it in their perspective. Self-studying AP Chemistry and getting a 5 after a summer of chemistry research shows amazing initiative. However, self-studying an AP that could otherwise be taken in the classroom, that is also related to your major, could be detrimental. The class is always valued more than the exam, same goes for AP scores vs grades - although very low AP scores may be seen as a sign of grade inflation.\n\n\n\n1. Min-max the hell out of your extracurriculars. For the majority of cases, it’s not about how many hours or how much you have done that matters; it’s how well you can express it on paper (or rather, an application portal).\n\n\n\n1. Enjoy your life. The min-maxing is there to give you maximum gaming time and hanging out, while also appearing as a very hard and productive person on paper. If you don’t enjoy these four years, you will feel burned out. And remember, what are you doing all of this for? The sentiment of the vast majority of people here is that  Good college = good job = good money = good life. Don’t forget to try to mix in a little of the end goal with the starting point sometimes. \n\n  \n\n\nTake this advice with a grain of salt; maybe don’t listen to me at all. Again, this is just from my experiences even if I’m stating these factually (yes, I know I have provided no sources. All of this is anecdotal and word of mouth). . Your mileage may vary. \n\n"

This process sucked, please know that everyone doing this is really, genuinely, emotionally resilient, and regardless of any of your decisions, please know you’re a really strong person for waking up each day and pushing through the time, stranding in academic purgatory. You’re a strong person for doing this, and I would have done this again next year if I didn’t get into any programs, but it would have been really painful and hard. \n\nI was raised in an area of Philly that was prolifically known for its open-air drug market and homelessness. My parents struggled with substance use disorder for all of my early life and I hated how selfish I thought addicts were for most of my life, until I became one. I’m an only child and was pretty isolated for most of my early life and saw school as a way out of everything. I felt like I was killing it for a really long time. I got a scholarship to a private high school in the burbs and got a full ride at a decent school in Chicago. Once I left Philly, from the ages of 18-23, my life felt perfect. My trauma gave me a weird level of entitlement, like “I deserve all these great things!” because my early life was so shitty. The year after I graduated I got laid off and dumped by my long term partner within the same month. Since 2016 I have been in and out of treatment centers, have been an absurd amount of sober homes up and down the East Coast, and ultimately became everything I hated, ran away from, and feared. \n\nEven before my last relapse, I would’ve told you sobriety was the best thing to happen for me - it gave me empathy for people, specifically people in my life I froze out because I thought they were selfish for choosing drugs and alcohol over me, and showed me first hand the strength and crushing weight of getting through life with the disease of addiction, especially when you have nowhere to go. Before my last relapse, I finally got some substantial sober time and with the help of a ton of people in life had a job and was a place to stay at sober house. I wanted to give back to the community and decided to head back to school in hopes of both helping individuals like myself (because I sure as fuck know I would not have gotten out of it without the help of strangers) and finding out about myself through the lens of academia. My first semester, during finals, I cracked under the pressure of graduate school and relapsed. I was kicked out of my sober house, wandered around for like two weeks, and eventually checked into rehab when I ran out of money.\n\nI was ashamed to tell the dean of my university what had happened and was POSITIVE they’d ask me to leave. Surprisingly, my dean was really understanding and was willing to give me a second chance (I owe this man a Bugatti). It sucked so hard that semester. I was living on my friends couch for 90% of it and spending next to nothing in the checks I got for being an RA so I could cover the first and last plus move-in fee for an apartment (ironic because an aspect of my studies is housing policies). All I wanted was to get to the next step - when I entered my master’s program it was because I did not by any means have the ability to get into an R1 PhD program - so this day has been my core motivation since the moment my I decided to go back to school. I’m really excited about this program because they have a cannabis policy institute, am I’m fascinated (and kinda jealous) of people who are California Sober and want to do ethnographic research on how weed can heal them without allowing it to ruin their lives - and other stuff. \n\nBUT - I more so posting this for two reasons:\n 1) to show life can REALLY change in an absurdly short amount of time. As good as this is I could go out there, drink, and be way, way, WAY, worse off then ever in my life - just within a days time. So if you’re flying high realize things can change pretty fast and you’re no better than anyone else, and if things didn’t happen the way you wanted them to you have a lot of leverage to make them happen your way, but it won’t happen overnight so don’t beat yourself up in the now. \n\n2) I have been told - COUNTLESS TIMES - to be very discreet about my substance use disorder because it will isolate me and put me at a disadvantage in people’s mind. A professor at my current university, whose research focus is STIGMA told me to stop being so open about my story in our academic circles and said it was a death wish to share aspects of my addiction in my personal statements. FUUUUUUUCCCCKKK the phony ass posers who don’t give a shit about the underprivileged populations they research and do it this research because they fell into it and like the prestige of having a PhD. No joke - on the first day of meeting my future (current now at my MA program) research advisor, who specializes in homelessness, when we were at a lunch in an outdoor patio section, a clearly mentally ill homeless woman came up to us while eating asking for money. HE NO JOKE TOLD HER “Please I’m eating…” and tried to shoo her away. I was originally interested in working with him because he studied the opioid epidemic specifically within the neighborhood of Philadelphia I was born and raised. I’ve been at this program for three years and within this time the homie hasn’t once stepped foot in the place, yet is getting paid to discuss it at conferences and write op-eds about it. \n\nThis is way longer than I wanted it to be so I’ll just cap it off there - you get the point. I really wanted to post this in hopes someone who thinks that life right now is too hard to function - it is, I’m telling you from having experienced all the bullshit in my life that this was almost as emotionally draining - so give yourself the most fucking credit for being able to be strong enough to get through this everyday! Life is pretty hard, a lot of the times, and what’s harder than getting into a PhD is just existing, and you’re emotionally a hero for that. "

Additionally, I would be moving closer to my family, and we were all excited about everything being perfect. Cut to today, and nearly everything has blown up in my face.

I’ve been told by some faculty that I should consider taking a few years off and working in industry in the meantime, as if there isn’t also a severe shortage of jobs which is about to get worse considering the number of folks in academia losing their positions.\n\nI know I’m not alone in this, people everywhere are feeling this pressure, but I’m so tired of grieving for science. I’m actually getting quite pissed off. To the point that it’s on sight the second I hear anyone in my life say anything remotely political regarding science, medicine, or education. I’m defensive all the time and it’s exhausting, but this political climate is literally ruining my life and I don’t feel like being kind or patient with people anymore. I don’t want to live my life this way, but I’m so over having to take two steps forward and one step back every time I make progress in my life. I’m not giving up, I’m already in my mid-30s and I have put way too much into this career, but just once - JUST ONCE - I need it to not be an uphill battle to do the right thing.\n\nOn the bright side, between surviving undergrad during a pandemic and getting a PhD in this dystopian nightmare, I can safely say that this generation of academics is going to be tough as nails. Not that we need anymore character building arcs.\n\n\n*************************************************\nETA some updates and clarifications for people who are confused by this situation: \n\n1) Yes, Columbia has a massive multibillion dollar endowment. However, it largely can’t be touched because endowments are usually tied up in resources like real estate and land, and even if it was liquidated is only allowed to be used in specific ways. It’s not like dipping into a savings account like a rainy day. I don’t know the finer points of university financials myself, but from everything I’ve read, you can’t expect it to be able to quickly cash in on that endowment because of various legal constraints. \n\n2) A scientific PhD is a 5 year commitment to completing continuous research with funding. This funding does not come from me. There is nothing I can do personally to raise money. This isn’t the same as an undergraduate degree where you just pay your tuition and you get to stay. Scientific research comes from grant funding. Running a lab costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions. I can’t just get a scholarship and be fine. It’s my research, not just me, that must be funded. If my lab does not have funding to support my project, it’s over. I get sent home and have to reapply for other programs somewhere else. There is no such thing as going for a year, then coming back a few years later when this blows over. I will have to start over from the beginning, and I don’t know if you know this, but graduate level work is HARD. It’s not something you want to keep doing over and over indefinitely. There may be options for transferring to a different lab, but that also comes with serious ramifications, such as having to start a multi year project over. \n\n3) Yes, Columbia is a hot bed for political troubles. Despite everything, I believe that Columbia is the best place for me because it has the project and faculty that I specifically want to work with. It is something I have had to consider, as well as all the challenges of living in NYC, but in the end, there is no escaping political unrest at this time. The current administration has made all of science and academia political. There isn’t a single institution that I have applied to or received an offer from that isn’t feeling extreme political and financial pressure at this point in time. I believe that these institutions and faculty are doing their best to protect their students and the future of research from a corrupt and reactionary political regime. They were served federal warrants and are being given ultimatums in order to restore critical funding. It’s not as easy as “they should stand up to the orange man!” They still have to comply with federal laws. You should be mad at government enacting these injustices, not the institutions being attacked. You might disagree. We’ll have to agree to disagree. I have too much on my plate to worry about your opinions on the matter. \n\n4) After talking to several people close to me and a few of my mentors, I believe I will still choose to go to Columbia regardless of the uncertainty. I don’t know if I’ll ever get an opportunity like this again in my life, and I think one year guaranteed funding there, learning and researching alongside some of the best scientists in my chosen field, is still better than deferring for a year and trying to find work in an oversaturated job market. I don’t know if I could forgive myself for giving up now when I’m so close to my dream. And who knows? It might work itself out in the meantime. \n\n5) I am still mad. Not at any faculty or institution for their honesty or doing what they have to do to survive in this climate, but at the political situation itself, the demonization of science and education, and the injustice of this administration trying to bully us into submission by attacking and targeting students and research. This will continue to be a hot button issue with me until it stops. The damage being done this year will ripple through upcoming years, and the fact that these deleterious policies are being applauded by goons who have no understanding of what they are cheering on will always play out in mind as I pursue my career in academia. I wonder if I’ll ever not be mad. "

    "score": 1457,
    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1gw0by5/some_perspectives_from_the_other_side/",
    "body": "I am a professor on the admissions committee at a medium sized T20 engineering department in the US and wanted to share some honest perspectives from the other side, as we often aren't allowed to explicitly answer certain types of applicant questions. For example, many applicants want to know our acceptance rate which are not supposed to share. My program accepts roughly 35-40 students out of 600+ applications, and our yield tends to be somewhere between 50-60% of those admits join the program.\n\n**Our process:** the admissions committee reviews applicants and ranks them on a score from 1 to 3, where 1 is excellent, 2 is good, and 3 is unsuitable. Most applicants are fairly realistic about their chances of getting in, I would estimate roughly 10% get rank 1, 85% rank 2, and only 5% of odd cases are ranked 3. After that, the scores and application materials are shared with the rest of the department. We are a direct-match program (i.e., students get accepted directly to individual lab groups, rather than as a cohort), so individual PIs then get to decide who they will interview. The admissions committee will make notes of which professors should look closely at which applicants. Not every professor will have funding for new PhD students every year, so many applications (even excellent ones) are never strongly considered. Rank 2 applicants are sometimes accepted if the research fit with the professor is very good.\n\nYou may have heard this before, but there is **no such thing as a safety school** for graduate applications. We routinely reject rank 1 applicants simply because there isn't a professor in their field of interest who has an open position that year. So having the best profile does not mean you will get accepted, you also need to get lucky that the right position in the right group is funded for you that year. For smaller, less research active schools, this means that there are often fewer positions available, so some of those programs may actually be harder to get into compared to larger and higher ranked programs like MIT, Michigan, and Georgia Tech which need to hire large numbers of students to support their massive research programs.\n\n**GPA matters.** While research proficiency is most important for a PhD, a poor undergraduate GPA doesn't bode well for your chances of successfully completing the pre-requisite coursework in a graduate program. These classes are hard, and if you are spending all of your time studying just to do okay, you won't have time to start research and your chances of passing the qualifying exam will be lower. Many professors consider \\~3.7 or above to be acceptable, but top applicants usually have 3.8 or above. I don't say this to discourage you if your GPA is lower, but I also don't want to sugar coat what type of profile tends to be accepted.\n\nA question I see all of the time is: **does research experience offset a mediocre GPA?** The diplomatic answer you'll get from most admissions staff is that applications are reviewed holistically and there is no minimum GPA. But the honest answer is: probably not. Several applicants will have both research experience and an excellent GPA, and in many cases the \"superstar\" rank 1 candidates will have a higher GPA **in addition** to more research experience than a rank 2 applicant with a decent GPA and some research experience.  Out of the 100s of applications I have read, I can only think of one case where a candidate had a 3.2 GPA but such excellent research experience and letters of recommendation that the application was still strongly considered.\n\nAnother common misconception is the importance of publishing as an undergraduate or masters student. Having a publication can certainly boost your application, but it is far from a prerequisite. We routinely accept students who have no publications. Doing science takes time, and doing good science is usually especially slow. In fact, having your name on subpar publications might actually work against you. I was recently contacted by an international masters student who has more publications than me, because their father is a professor who has been adding their name to all of his (not very good) publications for the last 6 years. I am fairly confident that this super-obvious \"gaming\" of the academic system will result in this student getting rejected from all top programs. Then they will go to grad cafe or reddit and complain about how impossible it is to get accepted into graduate school if they got rejected despite having X number of papers. So don't get discouraged if you haven't published when you read those types of posts!\n\nAnother common question seems to be whether international students are at a disadvantage. The sad answer is yes. This is for a few reasons: (1) there are many funding mechanisms only open to US students (the big one being NSF GRFP, but there are several others), making it easier for professors without enough funding to accept them, (2) we know exactly what a 3.9/4.0 from the University of Delaware means, it might be harder to evaluate a 9.0/10 from IISc, (3) we are more likely to have a connection to, or know of, the professors at American universities writing letters for those students. The deck is especially stacked against Iranian applicants. Although there are many wonderful junior scientists in Iran we would love to bring over, the reality of visa delays/rejections and extra scrutiny means many programs/professors can't or won't gamble on making offers to those students. If you are international, don't give up hope though! There aren't enough excellent American students to fill all the US programs, so most top schools still end up with a majority of international students. You just might need to apply more broadly than an American student would.\n\nMake sure to get your applications in on time, including letters of recommendation and IETLS/TOEFL scores. While exceptions might be made for superstar candidates, last year we weren't even forwarded the applications that weren't completed at the deadline. I had a few students reach out to me to ask if I'd seen their application, and I hadn't because their IETLS scores were delayed and the admissions staff had only sent us complete applications.\n\nMy final thought is to make sure your personal statement reads well, especially the first few paragraphs. This is the first part of the application we look at and we generally make a judgement fairly early in reading. I try to do the courtesy of reading each statement in its entirety because I feel that we owe that to applicants who put so much time into applying, but the reality is that many professors will skim the statements and make a snap judgement since we are analyzing so many.  If you aren't a strong writer, **use AI** to help! AI writing tools can help level the playing field for non-native English speakers. **However, do not** copy and paste directly from chatgpt. It is incredibly obvious when someone has done so. Make sure the statement still has your distinct voice and thoughts and does not include generic wording that doesn't tell us anything about you. Sentences such as \"I love XX field because I have always liked math and physics\" are true of every engineering applicant. I want to know more about you as a person, and every word you choose to include in this statement should help make your case. I realize that this is easy advice to give, and not easy advice to incorporate, but do your best to think about what makes you unique and interesting. Also, don't be afraid to brag a about your accomplishments. If you have published, won awards, conducted outreach, etc., include that in your statement. Give us context for awards we may not have heard of (selected out of XX applicants), include metrics of impact (my outreach project was shared with XX number of low income students). Give us context to your research experiences (how long were you with a group, did you work alone or under a postdoc/phd student, what tools did you use, what were your main contributions to any resulting publications, etc.). And of course, have someone proofread. Sentences that make sense to you might sound like gibberish to someone else, which is why we often cannot effectively evaluate our own writing.\n\nI hope this helps, best of luck with your applications everyone!\n\n  \n**Edit:** I am going to stop replying and close reddit on my computer soon, as I need to do some real work, but wanted to share a few final thoughts based on responses.\n\nA number of comments are asking for \"chance me\" based on their profile, which is really difficult to do. If you take away anything from this post, it should be that graduate admissions can be very subjective and even random, especially when decisions are left to each individual professor. You can absolutely be accepted to a top program with a 3.2, and you can also be rejected with a 4.0. The last thing I want to do is discourage anyone from pursuing their dream program, but I also want to be honest about what types of candidates are typically accepted to top programs. For example, my last few years of admits:\n\n* 3.5 UG, 3.9 M.S. International, 2 research experiences, 1 publication, 1 presentation, leadership experience, letter of recommendation from a professor I know and trust. SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific research field and as well as the application I care about\n* 3.85 UG, 3.95 MS. International, 2 research experiences, 2 presentations and 1 in-progress publications (but not published), leadership and volunteer experience. Referred by trusted colleague, excellent research fit.  \n* 16.5/20 UG, 3.7 MS. International, 3 research experiences, 2 publications, significant outreach experience, amazing letters of recommendation from unknown professors. SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific research and application I care about\n* 3.98 UG GPA. American, URM, 2 research experiences, no publications, significant outreach experience. Letter from a trusted colleague.  SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific field and and application\n* 3.8 UG GPA, dual major. American, URM, 2 research experiences, presentation but no publications, excellent leadership experience, referred by a trusted colleague. SOP a bit vague but good enough alignment with my research \n* 3.9 UG GPA, american. Top UG program. Awards, 1 research experience, one publication, 2 presentations, volunteer, leadership, outreach experience, excellent letters from unknown professors. SOP reflected good alignment with my research, but not with my application.  \n\nYou might notice a common theme is that referrals/letters from other professors I know personally hold a lot of weight. I have used the phrase \"take a gamble\" a lot in my comments, because that is what we are doing when we accept students. In between tuition, stipend, fringe, overhead, and research/travel costs, it costs over $100,000/year to train a PhD student at my institution. This is money we professors need to painstakingly fundraise. Because PhD positions are some weird combination of a job and a training program, making a bad hire can have an enormous impact on our research programs. It's not like a normal job where I can just fire someone if they aren't working out 2 months in. The last thing any professor wants to do is spend 200-300k training someone who ultimately isn't productive and burns out early because they actually don't care about the research area. This is why programs are so weird about \"**why us?**\" We want you to convince us that you will be happy and successful in this program and aren't going to drop out.  You might be the strongest applicant in the pile in terms of raw metrics, but if we don't see the clear alignment of interests you may not be accepted. \n\nPersonally, I am also very interested in personality match. I don't want to spend 5 years butting heads with someone because we have different priorities and working styles, and I especially don't want someone who will make the rest of my group miserable by being a pain to work with. This is why I put a lot of weight into personal recommendations from people I know. By the time I am interviewing candidates, it's really more of a \"vibe check\" than trying to assess competency. All professors are different though, some will really grill candidates for technical competency, which I personally find unproductive. \n\nFinally, if your profile is not as strong as the ones I have mentioned, please **do not despair** or give up hope on doing a PhD. I am describing the admissions process at a very competitive top program located in a highly desirable city. There are many R1s with high research activities and plenty of funding that don't make it onto top 20 lists. For example, state schools in \"rural\" states have access to a separate pot of NSF funding that coastal states do not have. The university of texas system has their own sizeable endowment. There are many excellent, T100 programs physically adjacent to top schools that are sometimes overlooked by applicants (i.e., NJIT near Princeton). Top schools located in less desirable locations will also be less selective. Because of the political climate there, colleagues from red / southern states have been complaining recently about not getting enough female and out-of-state applicants in their pools. Canadian programs have a very different funding mechanism than the US which results in more equitable distribution of funding across their various schools. Finally, try to find out if a program of interest has hired a lot of new professors recently, which suggests that the school has funding and potentially more openings for PhD students. \n\nIf you do decide to apply to top programs, make sure the alignment is clear in your SOP, and try not to take it as a personal failing if you end up not being selected. We all want to believe in a meritocracy with a fair and systematic process, but the reality is that professors making these decisions are just people and the system we use is sometimes arbitrary or downright stupid. We make mistakes, we overlook good candidates for stupid reasons or because of personal biases, we spend less time on applicants describing research interests far from our own fields, we forget to read the last 2 applications on the pile of 100s, etc. I know candidates often want to know \"what was wrong with my application that I didn't get selected?\" but this is the wrong way to think about it because there may have been nothing wrong with your application. In reality, it was just that something in someone else's profile that made them stand out to that particularly professor, such as a letter of recommendation from the right person. "

    "body": "Hey guys, I had the amazing opportunity to tour 8 colleges a last week! I know not everyone is lucky enough to get to tour the schools they’re thinking about applying to (perhaps maybe ED/REA), so I thought I’d share my experience and what stood out to me! Not sure how helpful this will be but hopefully it’ll provide at least some info for someone out there! Fair word of warning - these are kinda long bc I tried to be as detailed as possible, so pls skip to whichever school(s) interests you! \n\n**Brown:**\n\nInfo Session: OPEN CURRICULUM is the main thing here, the thing that makes Brown different. Aside from your major reqs (which you have to declare after 2 years), you can take any courses in anything. You’re completely free to explore your true passions and find what YOU want to do at the intersections of fields. Since people only take classes because they want to be there, it leads to a much more engaged classroom. Collaboration is a huge thing - since everyone is doing their own thing and following their true interests, competitiveness is pretty nonexistent. There’s a robust advising system in place due to all the choice so that students still stay on track. The tour was cancelled, so we had a student panel instead. Since the stuff they said is about Brown and not about the area/buildings, I’ll put it here under info. First off, let me say, holy hell. I almost switched my ED to Brown. You are either going to love the Open curriculum and Brown, or hate it. There is no in-between. These people seemed… so happy. Two were premeds (one PLME), one was prelaw, but they all seemed happy. I’ll paraphrase the PLME guy’s “why brown”: “I went to a very competitive high school, and I was doing all the things, running the race, top of my class, etc. Then I had to decide: did I want four more years of the same? Or did I want to be happy? I chose happy. \\[talked about his time at Brown for a while\\] Oh yeah, and I am happy.” Other premed guy was really happy too - they all were. As a girl said, “Here, your success does not depend on someone else’s failure.” And get this - they all still had insane ECs and involvements, research (80% of undergrads do research!), etc. Another girl explained this, and she said that since here, they were free to explore their true passions, all the other things they did WERE their hobbies, their social time, what they did for fun. They all truly loved everything they did. I truly love what I do in HS, but I definitely want to be surrounded by a community of people like that too, instead of all my depressed HS peers. And I want to be happy. Since everyone is so busy doing their own thing, it’s a really diverse space - everyone’s always doing their thing and nobody gets judged for it. They can take any class P/F, so grades aren’t really an issue, and they have like an 81% med school admit rate, and \\~80% to law school. Their students end up being competitive applicants for grad/professional programs despite being in this environment (or maybe because of it), and I think that’s poetic and beautiful. I ultimately decided against ED (sticking by my first ED choice - the polar opposite of Brown) because it’s like they say. You can take the kid out of the gunner environment, but you can’t take the gunner out the kid. Or something like that.\n\nSurrounding Area: Similar to Yale in every way (see Yale for more details). City that isn’t too big or too small - with enough bustle to be a city, but not enough to be overwhelming. Gapped row houses. Maybe a tad more crowded around campus? Student panel said the city itself is very artistic and creative, and has the most cafes per capita out of any city (didn’t fact check). Weather is also good - you get to experience all 4 seasons for sure. Basically - weather, art, and food.\n\nCampus Tour: We didn’t have a formal tour, but still wandered around campus, so here’s my thoughts of the campus. Again, it’s very much like Yale, maybe smaller. Roads run through the campus - it’s not a bubble. But it’s not overwhelming either - a nice Goldilocks zone. The med school buildings are pretty integrated into the undergrad stuff - we walked by a bunch of labs, undergrad buildings, and med school buildings all together. So there’s no clear separation of campuses like UPenn.\n\nKey Takeaways: Open Curriculum works, makes the environment way less competitive/stressful while still preparing students really well, not just academically but with ECs/research too. They genuinely seem happy. More so than anywhere else. A space where you’re free to be yourself, where they don’t expect you to have your life figured out at 17/18 - just your passions.\n\n**Columbia:**\n\nInfo Session: Didn’t have a formal info session, but a lot of what the tour guide yapped about was stuff that is usually covered in the info session (minus the admissions part), so I’ll put it here. 12000 in College (Arts & Sciences), 4000 in Engineering. Core curriculum for both, though College is more broad and Engineering is more applicable to engineering. Theme/mission for engineering is “engineering for humanity” - serving by applying knowledge to the real world. Lots of design projects in engineering. There are 200+ research centers, and labs are required to hold spots open for undergrads. Cold emailing works and usually the first one is a “yes.” There is a PE req and a swim test (for College only). There is guaranteed housing for all 4 years - 90% stay on campus. Everyone is assigned a general academic advisor who oversees and is the main point of contact, a major-specific advisor once you declare your major after the 1st year, and a pre-professional advisor for anyone going into grad or professional school. There is usually no class on Fridays, which are more of an “internship” day - lots of students get internships with the big firms like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, finance firms, etc. based in NYC - an upside of the location. Columbia students and classes (especially the core classes, which average 16-18 students) have a lot of philosophical discourse.\n\nSurrounding Area: I LOVE NYC. Baltimore and Philly were some other big towns I saw, and I gotta say I did not love those (especially Philly). But NYC was just… such a change from what I’m used to, in a good way. It’s relatively clean (there aren’t heaps of trash in the streets), and there are so many people everywhere, doing the most random things. Anyone from homeless people to businessmen to people jogging back and forth in front of a block. Everything is so close together and there are so many things everywhere. Definitely no row houses here like Baltimore and Philly - just apartments. I saw a subway for the first time!! (Though I didn’t get to go on it). I will say though, the drivers are terrible. Everybody jaywalks, and it’s impossible to drive past a crosswalk because there’s always someone crossing it when they’re not supposed to. And you also can’t go 30 seconds without someone cutting you off (and then they have the audacity to honk at you…) Traffic is also absolutely terrible, made worse by how aggressive the drivers are. But overall, I love the feel of NYC. Where I live, there’s a sense of isolation, because you’re always alone and everything is so far away. But with so many people here, always driving and walking somewhere, you’re never alone. There’s a sense that you’re a part of something bigger, something better, and I love that. Also, I don’t think you can beat NYC in terms of internship opportunities and industry.\n\nCampus Tour: It’s a decently sized campus, but it’s majestic and grand. Not in an old crumbly castle way though - in a regal way. Like you’re looking at something historical, but instead of looking depressingly old, it looks mighty significant. I really love the architecture here. They have different buildings for all the subjects - the Engineering building has the different Engineering branches on different floors. Campus is definitely somewhat of a bubble and not very integrated into NYC, but it’s right outside the gates. Overall I really love the campus here.\n\nKey Takeaways: NYC!! Nice for a large city, bustling, lots of internship opportunities due to the location. Campus is a great size and architecture is exactly the kind I like. High emphasis on core curriculum and getting exposure to lots of different fields via deep philosophical discourse to draw practical connections even if they’re not related to your major. Serving and having real life applications are big themes.\n\n**Harvard:**\n\nInfo Session: So, I actually really enjoyed the student panel at Brown (obviously I’d take a tour over a student panel, but it was still really helpful). Harvard was the only college to offer a student panel during the actual admissions info session (JHU had one student, but she didn’t talk much, while Harvard had 2 and the AO constantly asked them to talk about their experiences with X or Y). There’s 17 freshman houses, but they all eat at Annenberg hall (the Hogwarts looking thing). Then there’s 12 houses for all your other years, each with their own dining halls. 7:1 student to faculty, avg class size of 12 (though my tour guide said the intro lectures can be like 600-800, but they always split large lectures into sections of <30). You apply to the university and declare your major after 1.5 years. They really pride themselves on offering a liberal arts education and requiring students to take classes in a bunch of areas to be well rounded and knowledgeable about the world around them. So for application purposes, they want you to have interests and strong points in your profile, but not have ALL your ECs/interests be in CS or something. They have $7M in undergrad research funding annually, and there’s more research opportunities than students. They LOVE that phrase - 3 separate people quipped it to me when I asked them about research (felt kinda cultish lowkey). They also really loved to present Harvard as “choose your own adventure” - they said they don’t expect you to know what you’re going to do for sure (one of the guys on the student panel went in as a CS major and is now a senior in anthropology). They want you to explore things you’ve never done and keep doing them for the community you find. Oh, and they’re REALLY big on people, diversity, etc. - they kept saying the people make Harvard, that everyone is very different here which creates an interesting and connected community. So I guess if you and someone else have the same stats and similar ECs, don’t expect to both get in. Alumni interviews are offered on availability, but are highly recommended.\n\nSurrounding Area: Boston is BIG (as in, it took me an hour and a half to get from the Boston suburbs to Harvard). Cambridge is definitely a city. Maybe not compared to Boston, but definitely compared to the suburbs. Not really any row houses, mainly apartments, but they looked bigger than the ones in NYC. The streets were nice - not pristine, but much nicer than NYC/Philly. Not having homeless people follow you for 2 blocks also helps (true story). I think it’s right in the middle - if you’re from the city it won’t feel like being in the middle of nowhere, and if you’re from the suburbs or a rural area it shouldn’t be too overwhelming. Also, I just gotta shout out the gelato place at Harvard. They make rose shaped (!) gelato (!!) and you can pick as many flavors as you want (!!!) and each flavor becomes a rose petal (!!!!). I didn’t know about the multiple flavor thing until it was too late, but even with one flavor it was really good. The actual gelato was amazing too (I got pistachio). AND you get a free ice cream macaron. Not really free, just included in the price, but it was a nice surprise. The $13 bill was not.\n\nCampus Tour: It was the closest you can get to being an isolated bubble without actually being an isolated bubble. There were a few streets that ran through it, but for the most part there were huge pockets of Harvard-ness. Just a bit of the city was integrated - enough to have food places nearby, but not enough to feel like you’re not on a college campus. Also, the new SEAS campus is in Boston (a 40min walk/15min drive) from the main campus with the old SEAS buildings, so if you’re in engineering/cs/applied math you’ll have to shuttle back and forth a lot, which is kinda a downside. Other than that it was a pretty moderate campus in every other way - I really can’t see someone hating all 100% of it.\n\nKey Takeaways: You can literally drown in research here, THE GELATO IS TO DIE FOR, really great middle zone of city without as much bustle and campus integration into the city.\n\n**Johns Hopkins:**\n\nInfo Session: Got there like 15 mins early, a general video played that showed all the students having fun at different events. An AO gave the info session (not my regional AO sadly). Speech was very rehearsed but touched on everything you’d expect. Key things: 6:1 student to faculty ratio; 60% of students are from EDI/EDII pools; 85% of students do research/internships; 85% acceptance to med school (woo!) and 97% to law school. AO heavily emphasized the school mission - something about creating knowledge for the world. As someone who is gonna go into academia, this was super inspiring and really made me feel like the mission aligned with my ideas. They care about creating knowledge (if you wanna make a startup or go into research or have done this already), and sharing it by bettering your community (if you’ve had an impact in your community already). Also they offer lots of advising - general academic advising, specific advising for your major(s) and minor(s), career advising, etc. They emphasized that they don’t want you to have your life mapped out and know what your end goal is and exactly how you’re gonna get there - they just want you to know what you’re passionate about and what you want to do in the world, and have an idea about the paths you could take while being open to multiple paths/opportunities.\n\nSurrounding Area: Directly surrounding area looks kinda dangerous and run down, ngl. I live in suburbia so it may just be any big town that looks like that, but this isn’t the kinda place where I would feel 100% comfortable all the time. Lots of row houses (again - suburbia - we don’t have these! They look nice and quaint). The area around the hotel I stayed at (15 min drive away) was actually VERY nice - lots of people out and about, no graffiti, bunch of kids and adults playing soccer, basketball, tennis, etc. outside, definitely a place I would want to live in. \n\nCampus Tour: Actual campus was very nice and safe, didn’t look too old/run down and had some modern touches. Nice and spacious, with lots of quads. Definitely a traditional college campus - was very isolated from Baltimore and looked nothing like outside campus, like a little Hopkins bubble. They have a very neat gym/rec center. We went into one of the (lab?) buildings and there were a bunch of research posters on the walls. I read a few - looks like it’s pretty common for students to collaborate with profs here and at other unis. Student giving the tour spoke about how it was pretty easy to get research opportunities through good ole cold emailing and how profs were receptive to working with students (yayy). Also lots of talk about the collaborative environment - a parent asked about how competitive JHU was and like 3 students said everyone here helps each other. They genuinely seemed very nice - slightly introverted people who can yap for days.\n\nKey Takeaways: Hopkins be hopkinsing with that med school acceptance rate, huge emphasis on research and doing stuff for others (community), huge emphasis & resources for undergrad research, Baltimore isn’t as dangerous as everyone seems to say (maybe it is in some areas, but definitely not all).\n\n**MIT:**\n\nInfo Session: This has gotta be my favorite one by far (followed by Princeton and Yale in case anyone was wondering). This guy didn’t take questions, but if he did, I would have asked him about his public speaking skills, cause DAMN. Guy knew how to give a presentation. He was funny and amicable from the beginning. At the beginning when he was asking where everyone was from, what portion of the room was applicants/parents/counselors, etc. (stuff most AOs did), he asked if there were any alumni in the room. One girl raised her hand, and he said, “welcome home.” At MIT, they foster innovation and hands-on experience, and really revel in the whole nerdy scientist/engineer community. Their undergrad research opportunity program is the primary source of internships (in other schools they have similar programs, but most people get theirs through cold emailing). They do require you to take 8 humanities classes and 4 PE classes. 1st semester is Pass/No Record, and 2nd semester is A/B/C/No Record (so you can’t fail for the first year). REALLY INTERESTING STATS NO OTHER SCHOOL GAVE: upon graduation, 52% join the workforce (average starting salary of $115,461) and 43% go on to grad school. You apply to MIT, not to a major - in fact, 70-75% of applicants indicate interest in CS when applying, so you know most people don’t stick with their intentions. All undergrads take a similar set of 1st year courses, after which they declare their major. The AO then talked a bit about the separate application portal and how they use it because they’re looking for a specific set of students and the common app doesn’t help them find those. That’s why they don’t ask for a personal statement (but rather short essay responses), only have 4 activity slots, etc. He says they want to know why you think MIT is the best (what resources you’d use, professors, etc.) in your reason for applying, rather than just stating it’s the best. Interviews are assigned at random, but the tips he gave for the interview were to do your research on MIT, what professors you’d want to intern under, what programs you’d do, etc. and to bring a brag sheet/resume to either give to your interviewer if they ask, or to look at if your mind goes blank.\n\nSurrounding Area: See Harvard part for stuff on the city of Cambridge. The part of Cambridge that MIT is in is nicer than the part Harvard is in (sorry). Harvard’s area is nice and all, decently clean and without much (or any) trash in the streets. MIT area of Cambridge is PRISTINE. Like it literally could not be more clean and neat. MIT also has “MIT bubbles” like Harvard (see Harvard part), but it’s a bit more integrated into the city than Harvard. There were buildings for a bunch of big firms right near MIT’s campus. I walked into some research center that had a display on the 1st floor that was open to the public (because the topic of the research interests me) and walked out with the contact of one of the researchers there and a tentative virtual internship offer. So when they say MIT has insane research opportunities, it’s also the surrounding area.\n\nCampus Tour: Everything has a VERY modern look. There are no castle-like buildings, just concrete, glass, etc. Some of the buildings are older and some are newer, but none give medieval vibes like some other schools. Campus was also very very neat and pristine and clean. Not that much grass/quads though. I also gotta say, MIT must be on something because my MIT tour guide was also the best tour guide of any tour. He spoke about the MIT experience and campus life through stories and anecdotes, and was a really good storyteller. Some were his personal stories, some were MIT classics like the police car hack. It was an interesting way to approach a tour, since most tour guides just rattle off info and maybe a bit of their experience. This guy told stories, which I think explained the MIT vibe better than anything else could have.\n\nKey Takeaways: An absolute haven for nerdy engineers or stem people, every bit the stem community they market it as. The people are creative, innovative, their eyes sparkle when they talk about MIT. Campus and area are absolutely impeccable. This is kind of obvious, but research (and opportunities) are top tier.\n\n**Princeton:**\n\nInfo Session: A director of something admissions related (?) gave the info session. Confident and a really great speaker - not a rehearsed speech, and not an awkward one either. Just the right balance of jokes and passion to make you feel like it was a conversation rather than a presentation. Very undergrad focused school, ¾ of classes have 20 students or less, 5:1 student to faculty ratio, ALL classes taught by faculty, which includes 12 Nobel prize winners, some of whom even teach intro level classes. There’s a senior thesis req so everyone is required to do research, and most undergrads do research outside of that - profs are very open to working with students. Asked my tour guide about the ease of pubs, and he said it was pretty common for students to publish here. Cannot double major. 25% of the students are in engineering, the rest are in the regular arts & sciences program. You don’t apply to a major, just to a BSE or BA track (which you can then switch anytime before major declarations). Somewhere between Core and Open curriculums - you have to take courses within a certain focus area, but you get to pick which courses. Talked about the VERY strong alumni network a lot. 84% med school acceptance rate (lost by 1% to Hopkins lol), and 75% of undergrads eventually go on to higher education. They focus a lot on community and service and how you’ll contribute there. Also have a graded written paper req when you apply. At the Q&A portion, this girl had NO shame (I could never) and threw all these questions at the AO - about the eating clubs, how Princeton was handling political protests, etc. The AO answered the questions very gracefully and tactfully without actually answering them.\n\nSurrounding Area: SUBURBIA. Just like my old town back home… Honestly, it was really, really nice and safe and pretty. Lots of wild animals too, I saw a bunch of deer and foxes. Lots of houses, not many apartments or anything like that (though I assume they exist). Campus was somewhat of a bubble but it was big enough to still give the suburban feel, so it didn’t really feel like a bubble.\n\nCampus Tour: VERY big campus for a school that size, especially considering it has a set campus that’s separate from the city. But it’s still walkable and has shuttles that run back and forth. Expect lots of walking though - I’m a fan of long walks, so this isn’t an issue for me. Campus was very nice and clean, and had a lot of research peeps buzzing around. The labs were all open, and I got to trespass inside (shh) to check them out. Honestly, this is every researcher’s dream. There is SO much equipment, so many different labs, so many people… I will note that they use chalkboards, not whiteboards, which is a bit weird but to each their own. They’re also working on building a new Engineering building, which is HUGE and looks great.\n\nKey Takeaways: Suburban, small and undergrad focused, RESEARCH, sprawling campus with a nice, calm vibe.\n\n**UPenn:**\n\nInfo Session: The AO who gave this session was a more soft spoken man. Definitely didn’t feel as rehearsed. Even though there’s 10,000 students, most classes are taught by faculty and large lecture hall classes are rare. They were the only school that focused a lot on their founder (Ben Franklin), so taking a grateful and humble approach to the application will probably be an extra plus here. Said Ben Franklin embodied the school - interdisciplinary and exploring different fields & being an inventor/innovator in society by being the first to do something. They’re also really big on community - some classes incorporate community service projects, and they have lots of support systems for minorities. You can take classes at the graduate schools as an undergrad. They didn’t really have a “key thing we’re looking for in your app” - just the generic stuff. Interview is not considered in the admissions process and is purely for the applicant to get to know more about UPenn. I talked to a few students who had done research after the session - they all said getting research was super easy and the professors were very eager to work with students (9 in 10 profs had ongoing research), and that getting research even as a freshman was easy. Pubs are doable if you put in the effort.\n\nSurrounding Area: Again, this may just be me not being used to the city vibe, but there was lots of trash on the streets. A bunch of crumbling buildings and row houses, except instead of looking quaint like in the area of Baltimore I was in, they just looked run down. What I did like was that everything was kind of within the same area, from Penn Medicine and a few hospitals to the different graduate schools to the undergrad schools.\n\nCampus Tour: The campus is integrated into the city. It’s not one space for all the buildings like Hopkins. Also, each undergrad school has its own building (though you can take classes across any of the schools). The buildings aren’t in one isolated UPenn bubble - they’re within one area, but in the middle of Philly, with streets and stores between them. There are areas to the campus that feel less like a city - there’s a walkway with a bunch of trees, and in some locations you can barely tell you’re in a big city with a bustling street a short walk away. If you’re looking for something with a mix of big city vibes and nature feels, and don’t mind a campus that’s a bit integrated into the city, this campus might be right for you. I only got to go into Wharton, but I roamed around a bit - they only have group study rooms, but you can just go inside one alone which kinda defeats the purpose. The rooms are very nice, and so are the classrooms - everything looks clean and new. They have whiteboards.\n\nKey Takeaways: Definitely embraces the city instead of isolating the campus from it (cough cough Hopkins). Still manages to incorporate some nature. Great undergrad research opportunities. Don’t seem to want a specific “type” of student over others, aside from the things mentioned in the info session section (which are pretty basic things any college looks for).\n\n**Yale:**\n\nInfo Session: WAS HELD BY MY REGIONAL AO!!! As someone from an obscure area, I was sooo excited. He was really open about the admissions process, and truly believed fully in holistic admissions, inclusion, diversity, looking at context, etc. He seemed so genuine when he talked about it, and emphasized all these things A LOT. Said he has 2 questions he asks for admitting each student: How is the student going to contribute to Yale’s community? And: How is the student going to make use of Yale’s resources? Basically, he’s looking for how you’ve used resources in the past to grow, and what you’ve done in your community. He said, “Yale is not only a place of transformation, but a place to become what you’ve always been.” He looks for students who will transform in Yale in some way by using the resources, but also those who will use the resources to do what they’ve always wanted to do. For example, he mentioned how he’d always been afraid of public speaking, but at Yale he realized he’d always been a storyteller and started doing improv. They’re also really big on curiosity, spark, and passion - your unique story. You apply to the uni as a whole, not a major/college. Interviews are only if they want more info (all about that context/holistic admissions) - tons of people get admitted with and without them. And they’re looking for anecdotes specifically in the LOR. My tour guide actually talked more about Yale specifically than the AO (who only talked about financial aid and admissions - typically they talk about the school too). You can take up to 2 years to declare your major (but you can do it earlier). Yale is between Core and Open (like JHU and Princeton) - you have to take courses with a certain theme, but can pick which course you want to take that fits that theme. They have combined majors because double majoring is an option but hard - so instead of getting a major in math and a major in cs, you can get a single major in “math and cs.” There’s a 6:1 student to faculty ratio, with not many large lectures. Lectures are always professor led, but for larger lectures you might also have a TA for discussion groups (prof always has office hours tho).\n\nSurrounding Area: It was somewhat of a city (not suburbs like Princeton), but not as big/bustling as Philly, Baltimore, NYC, Boston, etc. Bigger than my city back home, and it definitely had a city feel, but not really a bustling feel. There were lots of these houses that were kinda like row houses, but with a tiny bit of spacing between them instead of being all smooshed together. \n\nCampus Tour: My tour guide had SUCH a competitive gunner personality, and was just such an ambitious, determined, knowing-where-you’re-headed leader. We also share the same first name, and honestly, that is who I aspire to be. Unlike Princeton/JHU, the campus was not a separate bubble. Roads did run through it. There was a whole road lined with STEM buildings (science hill?). Everything was very integrated though (unlike Columbia, where the engineering building was separate). Still, the campus was pretty nice. It had a lot of the old fashioned castle vibe, but everything was super neat (lawns, pathways, etc.) and I really liked the layout. \n\nKey Takeaways: Really nice Goldilocks town and school, truly values holistic process and background/context (maybe that’s just my AO tho). Cares a lot about diversity - of everything, socioeconomics included (they spent so much of the presentation on financial aid - longer than any other school). Lots of places say these things, but here at Yale it felt most genuine."

    "body": "I know how anxiety-inducing, stressful, and confusing the PhD admissions experience is, and I wanted to share some of the things I’ve learned along the way. If you have any specific questions I didn’t cover here feel free to ask, and if you want help on your specific situation feel free to message me!\n\nBrief background: I gained admission to 10 PhD programs, all of which were in the top 20s for their respective fields (Chemical Biology, Biosciences, Molecular and Cellular Biology)— 5 were in the top 10 in the United States. I got 5 rejections. I now participate in my program’s student admissions committee, meaning that I participate in the evaluation of applicants, interview students, and get an inside view into the admissions process. I’ve also helped many prospective students with their applications, so I’ve seen a lot of the common pitfalls that come with these kinds of applications. I love helping people figure their path, and I find myself giving many of these pieces of advice to everyone who is applying so I thought I’d put it all in one place in case any of you are in this boat.\n\nBecause I had a low GPA and less undergraduate research experience than my peers, I was extremely intentional about how I approached the process, and tried to set myself up for success as much as possible. While this is nowhere near comprehensive, I wanted to share some of what I’ve learned. Much of this is geared towards PhDs broadly in the biological sciences in the US, but I hope much of it translates to other disciplines. \n\nPicking schools and programs\n\n* Before doing anything else, clarify *what* you want to do and *why* you want to do it. If you don’t know the answer yet, you may not be ready for a PhD. I often see applicants who want a PhD but don’t care deeply about a specific problem or field. That lack of authentic passion comes across clearly in applications and interviews. You don't have to narrow it down to a granular level but you should have broad scientific questions you're eager to address. The best thing you can do is focus and narrow your field.\n* You might assume that applying to many different fields or types of programs increases your chances of getting in somewhere, but that’s not necessarily true. PhD programs heavily weigh your demonstrated interest in their specific discipline. If you have relevant experience and can talk about it with insight, passion, and clarity, you’ll stand out.\n* Start with the type of research and the PIs, not the school or the program. Once you know what you want to study, identify faculty whose work aligns with those interests. This matters far more than rankings or school names, and the process takes time. If you can list PIs whose research connects to your background and interests, your application will be far more compelling.\n* Figuring out what you want to study and narrowing that down is a process in itself. Broadly: read as much as possible, attend as many seminars as you can (especially in person), ask questions, and speak with the presenters if possible.\n* Lots of informational interviews with students. I probably had around 20 coffee chats with current PhD students, asking about their paths, how they got into grad school, and what kind of research they’re doing now. These conversations helped me clarify my own goals and direction.\n* Don’t treat this like applying to college. You don’t need “safeties”—the safety is simply not doing a PhD. Don’t apply to programs you wouldn’t seriously consider attending. It’s a waste of time, energy, and money.\n\nShowing real passion\n\n* Programs want to know that you genuinely want to pursue a PhD, and it’s difficult to fake true enthusiasm. A PhD is long, and difficult— if you don’t love this kind of work, you’re unlikely to stick with it. Don’t be afraid to show your excitement in your personal statement, emails, and interviews.\n* A PhD requires initiative and independent. If you can’t do basic research about a program, lab, or field, that’s a red flag. Don’t ask questions that are easily answered by a Google search or on the program’s website. The people you're contacting, like faculty, administrators, and students, have more input into admissions than you might expect.\n* On the flip side, asking thoughtful and specific questions works in your favor. It shows that you’ve done your homework and are seriously interested. I have a long list of questions I asked PIs during interviews: questions about mentorship style, research direction, lab culture, etc. Never ask something you could have found online.\n* Remember: a PhD is a professional degree. Act accordingly. Proofread your emails. Treat everyone with respect. Be proactive and prepared. How you conduct yourself in these small interactions reflects on your overall readiness for this type of work.\n* And if you’re not quite ready, that’s completely okay. There’s no shame in taking time to work before applying. I did, and it benefitted me immensely.\n\nEmailing/connecting with PIs before applying\n\n* At many schools with rotational programs, admissions decisions aren’t just a matter of ranking applicants. If a PI on the committee likes you, you may be evaluated differently. That’s why making connections in advance can give you an edge. It’s absolutely essential for direct-admit programs, and still very important for rotational ones. \n* That said, I’ve seen a lot of poorly written PI emails that probably hurt the applicant more than they helped. When contacting a PI, your main goal is to demonstrate why you’d be an asset to their lab and express your genuine interest in joining if admitted. If you have a clear vision for your PhD, that will come through naturally. Avoid sending a generic or templated email. Do ask to meet if they have time. And don’t be discouraged if they don’t respond—it doesn’t necessarily reflect your chances of admission.\n* You can also email them with specific questions; for example, if they have multiple affiliations, you can ask them which program they think would be a better fit to apply to if you’re interested in their lab. \n* If you have a direct connection to a PI of interest, use it. For example, if your current PI collaborates with someone at a school you're applying to, ask them to make the introduction (ideally by email, CCing you).\n* Reaching out to big-name, senior PIs with huge, well-funded labs usually doesn’t lead anywhere. Focus instead on early- or mid-career faculty whose work genuinely excites you. They’re more likely to respond—and more likely to be on the admissions committee.\n\nEssay writing \n\n* START EARLY. I guarantee every school is going to ask for slightly different essays and while you can recycle some material, it’s going to need to be highly tailored to each school. They will definitely be able to tell if it’s a copy-paste situation. \n* Spend a lot of time in the brainstorming stage of your essay. Don’t sit down and try to write something complete from start to finish; I guarantee it will be bad. Instead, take the time to reflect on your path and your motivations, and write down everything that comes to mind. Even if 1% of this brainstorm is usable, it will be worthwhile. Then, you can slowly shape it into an essay. \n* Proofread!! Submitting something with the wrong school name, a misspelled PI, or careless errors signals a lack of attention and professionalism.\n* For rotational programs, the unspoken convention is to list three professors you are interested in working with, along with a brief few sentences about why you want to work with them and what you can contribute. You can deviate from this but it worked for me and many others. \n* Speaking with current students will both help you narrow down your schools list and give you good talking points in your essay. They want to see that you are aware of the unique strengths of the program, and that you will take advantage of their resources.\n* Get as much feedback as possible on your essays. Send it to your professors, to current students, post-docs you’ve worked with, etc. \n* Nobody talks about this, but many people with the financial means to do so hire a professional application consultant to help shape every aspect of their application. While I believe this is not at all necessary, recognize that you’re competing against people with the resources to fully polish each element of their application with the help of an expert. In order to compete, your best bet is going to be to solicit as much mentorship and feedback as you possibly can from professors and peers. \n\nHow to speak and interview well\n\n* I find that undergraduate researchers are often not very good at articulating their work in the broader context of the field. While you do not need to be an expert, you need to be able to explain what you were doing beyond the basic assay. When someone asks about your research, or when you need to write about it, don’t start with the technique; start with the problem. Convince them that it’s important, explain where the gap is, explain how your work fills the gap, and finally tell them what you’re specifically doing. \n* This is where reading widely and attending talks comes in handy. For example, if great novelists did not read books themselves, they would not know how to write good books. Similarly, if you don’t immerse yourself in the language scientists use to talk about their research, you will be at a disadvantage when it comes to explaining your own work. \n* Get good at asking questions! If you’re still in school force yourself to ask questions during class and in seminars. When reading a paper think of questions to ask that cannot readily be answered by Google or by a second read of the text. The questions you ask during informational interviews with PIs or during real interviews might say more about you than your answers to questions. \n* Formulate answers to common interview questions thoughtfully. Be earnest, don’t exaggerate or try to paint yourself in an overly positive light, but do show your genuine passion. \n* Practice a lot!! Practice with peers and with professors and mentors. Informational PI interviews (set up by emailing them) are a great way to gain interview practice to prepare for real evaluative interviews. I have a long list of interview questions I can provide if it would be helpful! \n* At the interview weekend, act as if absolutely everybody is evaluating you, even other prospective students. We overhear conversations, and we see how you treat your peers. At the interview stage, we’re looking for any reason to decline somebody; don’t give us anything. Do show real curiosity, and engage with current students as much as possible. This will ultimately help you make a choice! \n\nUltimately, as stressful as this application process is, it’s also a really beautiful time to reflect on your path thus far, and to clarify what you want to do in the future. When you approach the process with this mindset, it becomes a little less intimidating and more exciting!\n\nI hope at least some of this was helpful— I’m happy to answer any specific questions or do my best to help in any other way!"

    "body": "just as a general statement to anyone who reads this: if you are aiming to practice/study medicine within the U.S., you have to come to terms with the fact that like many things, medicine has been and will continue to be inherently political. paying attention to politics is not only important (especially right now) to general life, but these things impact us, our ability to attain our goals, our patient populations, and the health of our country. \n\nif you’re aiming to be in this career field in the year 2025, there should not be anymore “oh yeah i don’t really care about politics” or “yeah that doesn’t affect me”. it is an immense privilege to remain naive about politics because regardless of if you do politics, politics will without a doubt eventually always do you. physicians in a social hierarchy have a position of power, our leadership and advocacy for our patients does not end when we step out of the hospital or exam room because advocating for a better healthcare system is in fact patient advocacy. some of the most important patient advocacy we can do is when we form community and speak up. \n\nas is, the current bill (HR 1) in the senate will severely limit the ability for people to see medical school as attainable by sunsetting graduate plus loans and capping unsubsidized graduate loans. for those who may be low income or non traditional or have faced hardships may not even qualify for private loans due to required credit checks. not everyone has a good credit score, income, or someone in their corner to agree to cosign on something they might & can negatively impact their credit score as well. are private loans options when they cut the grad loans and cap the unsubsidized loans? sure. are they options for everyone like federal loans? absolutely no. not to mention predatory APRs that will inhibit payback on principal loans. \ni haven’t even touched on how much we will feel from the major changes to PSLF and repayment restructuring - it will be felt and it will most likely affect you unless you are lucky enough to never have to take out loans for medical schooling. \n\nnot only does this bill seek to cut pathways to attain our goals, but it is estimated that $900+ million will be gutted from medicaid. this ALSO affects you and your future patients and patient populations and who you treat as a doctor and what hospitals you can work at. many in elderly patient populations use medicaid to help them with covering their nursing home stays. many pregnant women and children and those with legitimate disabilities will lose care they desperately need. and i am not even talking about proposed cuts to medicare such as the cutting of the medicare physician payment relief program that will jeopardize practices and care for those over the age of 65. \n\nHHS also just gutted the advisory committee on immunization practices, or ACIP, by firing all of the highly qualified non partisan physician experts and replaced only 8 slots with many who have directly threatened one of the biggest public health innovations we have ever had: vaccines. practicing medicine IS weighing the risks and benefits for your patients and talking them through it to make sure they’re know that they’re choosing the most educated decision for themselves, including vaccinations. to sow public distrust by utilizing your expert title does more harm than good and isn’t adherent to evidence-based practices. \n\nER physicians cannot fully treat their pregnant patient populations to the best of their ability at this time due to non specific reproductive right laws within states because they fear repercussions of lawsuit/jail time. EMTALA guidance regarding emergency care of pregnant patients was just recently rolled back. OB/GYN providers are being sued/facing extradition cross country for prescribing a medication that they counseled their patients on and they both decided was the best thing for the patient at that time, even if they practice in a state where this is legal. a Georgia woman was kept alive via life support against familial wishes because she was carrying a 9 week old fetus at the time of declared brain death. \n\ntldr; as it stands today, this career path is directly political. these things are real and they affect you, your future patients, your communities now and in the future, and more. you should care because it matters. \n\nyour voice also matters; continue to call your representatives and speak on issues that affect you, medicine or not medicine related. including reps that you think are already aware of these things but you feel are not getting advocated for. apps like 5 Calls can be a tool for you. your representatives serve you, not the other way around.

However, I had tremendous luck and outstanding mentorship to help me figure all this out. Here are some more details abt my app and then some of the things I found most important/useful throughout the process:\n\nClinical Experience: I started out as a patient transporter in a community hospital, then got my EMT cert, then transitioned to holding two simultaneous PCT jobs at big urban hospitals. I think the variety of pt population and practice setting really helped my narrative.\n\nNon-Clin Volunteer: Most of this was tutoring. I know a lot of people don't think tutoring is volunteering, but I think its just fine. I'll add here that I had a second volunteer tutoring gig that I didn't put on my primary application, but spoke about heavily in secondaries and in interviews. \n\nAthletics: I was a club team captain, but when I discussed this, it was mostly from a leadership and community enrichment perspective. \n\nResearch: This is all full-time, post-grad employment. Unfortunately, I think a lot of research is very luck-based. I got into a lab at just the right time and worked my tail off, but I honestly can't even pretend I'm an excellent scientist or anything. I was just lucky to have good timing getting my job and tried to capitalize on opportunities that were thrown my way whenever possible. \n\nAlso, I got a 2nd quartile casper and didn't take Preview. \n\n1) Asking for help is a learned skill, which if practiced, can help you find mentorship. Seeking mentorship (esp as a post-grad) was a theme throughout my app, and one that seemed to resonate with secondary readers and interviewers. It's also just a great way to get good info on how to present yourself if, like me, felt a little out of your depth trying to figure out how this all works. Reddit has a lot of good info, but nothing compares to IRL mentorship from professors, managers, PIs, or med students you know. \n\n2) Take advantage of your alumni network! Medicine is full of people who are more than happy to pay it forward, especially to people who come from similar backgrounds. \n\n3) Bust ass on your personal statement. This is pretty obvious, but finding a cohesive narrative for yourself that you can establish clearly in your personal statement and then expand upon in more detail throughout secondaries and interviews is a great way to present yourself as a multidimensional, self-examined individual. It's also a fun way to learn more about yourself!\n\n4) Take your secondaries seriously. Do thorough research into the schools you apply to, come up with 4-5 stories about your experiences that apply broadly to the major themes asked about in secondaries, and definitely write individualized \"why us\" essays for every school. It shows you care, and I think it makes your app more sympathetic to the reader.\n\n5) Try to get insider info for interviews. For every interview I took, I tried to speak with a current or former student of that school to get an idea of what really matters to them, and how I could present myself as someone who would add value to their community. People are often more than happy to chat for 15-20 mins on the phone. \n\n6) Do everything as early as possible. Submit your primary on the first day. Submit secondaries within a week, schedule your interviews ASAP after the invite. It demonstrates initiative, organization, and interest in the program. \n\nSorry this was long as hell, but thank you to the premed reddit community for helping me get to this point. I wouldn't even be pursuing medicine if it wasn't for this forum, and I hope everyone achieves their goals!!!\n\n"

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a second-year med student at the University of North Carolina who got accepted to med school after three cycles and MANY rejections. I’m not really one to post on Reddit, but I really don’t like med school admissions. I don’t think the best applicants get in each year, and I think the process has a lot of flaws. So if anything I learned during my three years in the trenches can help someone who is where I was two years ago, then I want to share it.\n\nI have a pretty big sample size of schools, and by the end of it, I had done most of the typical premed experiences. I don’t really consider myself a special applicant with any sort of X factor, so I feel like my advice might be more generalizable than people who had super high MCAT scores, some crazy backstory, or other wild variable that helped them get in. I’m really just a dude who wants to be a doctor because I like science and want to help people (don’t put that on a personal statement).\n\n**Background on how my cycles went**\n\nStats (same all three cycles): GPA 3.7 with a 4.0 post-bac, 514 MCAT School background: Majored in Econ and decided to go to med school 2 months before I graduated college in 2019. That’s really where my application began—before that, I had essentially just focused on making the best grades I could, aside from a few short summer jobs. No prestigious internships or anything crazy.\n\nI minored in astronomy, so I had already taken a few science classes, but most of my prereqs came from my post-bac program. I did undergrad at UNC and my post-bac at American University in DC.\n\nFirst cycle:\n\nFirst time I applied, I felt pretty good about my application. I had pretty decent stats, 10 months working as a scribe, had just started working as a CNA, and had some volunteering experience. I had some great mentors giving me advice and definitely did my research before applying. I thought I had good writing, applied early in the cycle, and stuck to schools that don’t favor in-state applicants too much.\n\nUltimately, I got 3 interviews and no acceptances. I applied to about 30 schools. I was bummed but not too discouraged because I knew a lot of people don’t get in on their first try.\n\nSecond cycle:\n\nFelt really good going into this cycle. I had worked as a CNA for a year, which I loved and wrote about super passionately. I really thought this would show through since I’d been told getting into med school was not about checking boxes—you need to do things you’re passionate about. I also had more volunteering experience this cycle.\n\nEnded up getting only 2 interviews and no acceptances, so I did worse, which made no sense to me. I applied to about 35 schools.\n\nThird cycle:\n\nI was stressing bad because I felt like I had been doing all the right things and working harder than I ever had before but still couldn’t get in anywhere. My MCAT was going to expire after this cycle, and I wasn’t sure I could go through that again. Also got the lowest quartile on Casper (can rant about Casper for a while, but we’ll hold off).\n\nSome days I would just wake up at 3:00 AM with heart palpitations or my mind racing, and I’d be like, “Well, I guess I just have to start my day.” It sucked. I held nothing back this cycle and applied to an absurd 68 schools.\n\nI added a research experience (no pubs or poster) and had around 100 hours volunteering at a free clinic. Amazingly, I got 18 interviews, so many I had to start turning them down, which I never thought would happen. Of the 9 I attended, I got 7 acceptances and 2 waitlists.\n\n**What made the difference between the second and third cycle?**\n\nFirst off, I applied to DO schools for the first time and had a lot of success, so just broadening my school selection helped. But I also had a huge jump in MD success, which I think speaks to the changes I made.\n\n*Check every box*\n\n- When I was doing my research for applying, I came away with the impression that med school admissions was supposed to be holistic and not about checking boxes. So instead of doing scientific research, I put most of my time into being a CNA, something I was passionate about and that aligned with my reasons for studying medicine.\n- But saying med school isn’t about checking boxes is really only half true. I only saw wide-spanning success when I maxed out all parts of the rubric. Me being a CNA—no matter how passionate I was—just wasn’t enough to overcome my lack of research and underserved volunteering.\n- When schools decide who to interview and accept, I can say with pretty high confidence they use some kind of rubric. Anytime you’re being graded by a rubric you better have all categories accounted for. I don’t have a copy of a rubric and don’t know exactly what each school uses, but you really want to cover all your bases.\n- Doing research didn’t change my motivation for medicine at all. I loved my lab, and the research they were doing was cool—but I essentially just pipetted for a year. That’s the game though.\n\n*Big experiences you need to hit:*\n\nStrong clinical experience (CNA and EMT are the strongest IMO. Medical assistant also works. I have mixed feeling about being a scribe, but plenty of people get into med school scribing. I was both a scribe and a CNA and found having a hands-on experience where you’re actually talking to patients way more impactful and way easier to write about. Is being a scribe even a thing right now with AI???)\n- Underserved volunteering (non-clinical is actually encouraged, but if you do clinical volunteering, try to do it at a free clinic)\n- Research\n- Shadowing (I think it’s dumb, but just do it—it might be part of a school’s rubric)\n\n*Don’t waste time on things you can’t write or speak passionately about*\n\nChecking the boxes is not enough—but it’s the first step. Next step is making sure the boxes you’re checking actually matter.\n\nOne of my volunteer experiences was Red Cross blood drives. I had 200+ hours volunteering where I just checked names off a list. Super hard to write about. Contrast that with volunteering as a medical assistant at a free clinic, where every shift brought a new story and I interacted with patients every day. That experience practically wrote itself—same with being a CNA.\n\nSome of my experiences were a complete waste of time, but I did them because they were easy. Don’t do that. Do stuff that’s hard and makes you grow—it will be worth it. You’ll be able to talk about it passionately and become a better person because of it.\n\n*Make your experiences into a narrative (you can do this retroactively)*\n\nFor some reason admissions committees are addicted to the idea of a narrative. If you’re like me and don’t have some crazy story or special reason for wanting to do medicine, this can seem hard. But you can actually craft this narrative retroactively.\n\nExample: When I got my research job, I applied to every research job in North Carolina I could find that I was remotely qualified for—over 120. Only one gave me an offer, it was a lab researching an HIV vaccine. Since I only got one offer, I didn’t really have any choice on which job to take. Me not having any other option is one story I could’ve told med schools, but that’s not a very good story. Instead, I framed it like this:\n\nAs a CNA and volunteer MA in my hometown, I saw how much my community struggles to accept vaccine science and often distrusts medicine. How do I know vaccines are safe? What goes into making them? I wanted to take an active role in vaccine research so I could better serve as a liaison between my hometown and the scientific community.\n\nWay better story than “this was the only job that got back to me.” Even though both are true.\n\nTry to connect all your experiences—even retroactively. Life is unpredictable and sometimes you have to do experiences just simply because they’re the only option, but you can be creative and craft a logical connection or narrative after the fact, and it looks way better than dumping a bunch of random experiences on your app.\n\n*Interviewing*\n\nInterview stage I had a high interview success rate my third cycle and was either waitlisted or accepted at every school I interviewed at. My biggest advice here is don’t focus on “being yourself.” Focus on knowing yourself. By this point in the process, I had written about myself so much, and put a lot of work into my secondaries in primary application over three years. I knew my story so well, and I had countless anecdotes to back it up.\n\nMy formula:\n\nState your opinion then back it up with an experience.\n\nEvery time you have an ethical dilemma, hard day at work, or meaningful patient interaction—write it down. One well-known story can answer 50% of interview questions just by tweaking which part of it you emphasize.\n\nIf you’re doing experiences that are meaningful and actually making you grow, you’ll have plenty to talk about.\n\nLean into your interests outside of medicine. Be specific. Most interviews are predictable, some are super random — but if you know yourself, you’ll adapt.\n\nSometimes they just want to know have you thought about things critically. One of my interviews spent the first 15 minutes talking about how speaking English allows you to travel almost anywhere and still find people who understand you, whereas other languages don’t. I did that interview from Japan at 3AM in a T-shirt and gym shorts because I had planned that trip for late March and then got an interview invite on the flight over there. That topic made up 1/4 of my interview and it was just a random thing I found interesting as I was traveling. I got into that school.\n\n**School selection**\n\nWhere you apply matters so much. On my third cycle, I had a massive spreadsheet with every med school in MSAR and their out-of-state interview percentages.\n\nBut also, even with all the growth I had on my third cycle, I still received 45 rejections! A lot of this process is luck and who reads your app—but you can still stack the odds in your favor.\n\n**Why should you listen to me?**\n\nI was down bad. I was rethinking my whole life. If I didn’t get in, I was maybe gonna try to go to a Caribbean school, but I don’t know. My whole path was up in the air. I really know what it’s like to not be able to get into med school. I easily received over 100 rejection emails and was probably rejected from 70 different schools in total. That’s an embarrassingly high number, but I did learn A LOT through all the rejections and had some great mentors along the way.\n\n**Closing**\n\nI have so much more advice I could give on med school admissions and so many things I could rant about but I won’t make this post 20 pages long.\n\nIf this helped anyone, I’d be happy to rant about other topics or even make a video going through the specifics of my application and why I think I was successful at certain schools. I have no shortage of rants. I lived and breathed this for three years. I truly wish I didn’t know as much about admissions as I do.\n\nIf you’re struggling to get in, I know how heartbreaking it is to work incredibly hard for something and fail.\n\nFor the longest time, I thought getting into med school defined me. I put all my self-worth into whether or not I could get accepted. Now that I’m in med school, I realize how dumb that was.\n\nIf you really want this, don’t quit. Give it your all. Failure is growth. But don’t ever attach your self-worth to this process. It has so many flaws, and admissions committees are full of contradictions.\n\nMost importantly medicine is not everything—not even close. Find fulfillment in your life right now. Don’t attach it to an arbitrary goal or you will never find happiness. I’m still trying to master that myself."

    "body": "Hi all. I keep seeing iffy advice online about writing the statement of purpose (SoP). My goal isn't to defend the status quo here, but to explain it so that you can write better ones.\n\nIt's a mistake to think you should meticulously follow the instructions for each section. Pay attention to length requirements, but otherwise, write statements that convey your growing mastery of the field you want to enter and impressive relevant achievements. Your excellent description of the field should be one of those achievements.\n\nThe truth is that most professors have *no idea* what the prompts for these sections are. We didn't write them. If it says to describe your research experiences and blah blah, then yes, your research experiences should be in there somewhere, but that's not the best way to frame the statement.\n\nScientists in particular are accustomed to a grant format that opens with a scientific problem, explains why it's important (\"significant\"), and then provides more detail on why it has been hard to solve this problem, and what the current data show. In real grant applications, we usually explain why our proposed experiments are thus the inevitable and urgent next steps, and then we describe how our investigative team is perfectly poised to do the work, and then we provide more experimental detail to raise excitement and demonstrate credibility.\n\nYou don't need to propose specific experiments (and probably shouldn't), but you should demonstrate that you understand your favorite scientific problems, why they're important, and what has been done on them. You can then describe your relevant research experience and why specific lab(s) and programs would make an excellent fit. \n\nKeep the focus on the scientific problem. Strong writing here demonstrates your motivation, aptitude, and readiness much better than a long summary of your research experiences in undergrad (which are usually not so interesting for us to read about, no offense). When you describe your research experience, remember we care mostly whether you understand well the science you were doing, made real contributions, and were a nice colleague to work with.\n\nThis perspective comes from >10 years on admissions committees in the biological and physical sciences, noticing which applicants rise to the top. I'm of course curious if any profs on thus sub have a different view. "

    "body": "\n\nEdit: Mods feel free to verify!!\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not intending any of the info I put here to serve as advice!! There are many ways to get into/stand out to colleges, and just because my AOs liked something in my app doesn’t mean you need it. In fact, my number 1 piece of advice after reading it would be to show yourself as honestly as you possibly can in your college apps. I’m just posting because I thought it was an interesting experience, and remember liking to “see” inside the admissions office with these kinds of posts when I was an applicant. \n\nBrief background: applied REA to Yale, was deferred and accepted RD. Current freshman. White, female, upper middle class. Was valedictorian in a class of ~800, large public hs, weighted GPA of 100, 1520 superscored SAT. \n\nOk now to the good stuff: \n\nReader 1 (my regional AO): \n- the first thing she wrote down about me after my demographic info and ECs was that I had an op-ed published in a somewhat-known online magazine in 10th grade, which I listed as my first award on CA. I found this really interesting because I personally didn’t think it was that impressive, and remember stressing out about my awards being weak. But it was the first way she identified me as standing out. \n- then she wrote some info about my common app essay topic. Imo my common app essay was probably the strongest part of my apps, but both readers talked about it far less than I expected. It was noted that I had an “interesting perspective on the world” due to what I wrote about. \n- the third thing she mentioned was something in my additional info section, that I had wrote to explain why I stopped one of my ECs. I remember being really anxious about how I would be perceived based on quitting (particularly bc it was a self-started initiative) and what I wrote about why, but the AO wrote that she really respected my honesty about why I stopped. \n- recommender 1: AO quoted my teacher as saying I was “the most driven in 15 years of teaching,” but criticized that I didn’t come off as very intellectually curious in the letter\n-recommender 2: put in a few quotes as well, particularly that I was a “dynamic force” which is something reader 2 loved as well \n- counselor rec: mentioned a specific program I was in at school, highlighted leadership. AO noted that I “topped with visible school leadership”\n- final notes: stressed my unique lived experience, how I was top of my public school. Indicated wanting more info from my interview, and then later added a note that I came off very passionate in my interview which was good \n\nReader 2:\n- way fewer notes here, really just a paragraph of text. noted that I seemed confident, that she really got to “meet me” in the essays, and also that she liked my rec letters. \n- also wanted an interview, noting that I seemed like a “strong personality” \n\nNumbers (from other posts, sub components are out of 9 with higher #s being better while the final rating is out of 4 with lower #s being better) \n\nReader 1: \n- ECs — 5\n- Rec 1 - 5 \n- Rec. 2 - 6 \n- Counselor rec - 5 \n- Final rating -2 \n\nReader 2:\n- ECs - 5 \n- Rec 1 - 6 \n- Rec 2 - 5\n- Counselor rec - 6\n- Final rating - 2\n\nBiggest takeaways: \n- my LORs and interview were clearly really, really important in my case \n- interesting that the two first things they mentioned were things I originally thought were somewhat insignificant. Really goes to show that you should mention everything, even the accomplishments or acknowledgments that you’re less sure of! \n- I was surprised that they wrote almost nothing about my supplemental essays. Just one sentence of summary on one of them with no added commentary, and nothing on my why major, why yale, or short takes."

    "body": "Tis the season, so I thought this would be a good time to share my tips for acing your med school interview!\n\n**AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE AN INVITE:**\n\nFirst things first: book a date! Sooner is better. When it comes to time off work/school, generally ask forgiveness, not permission (unless there’s something really big you’d be missing that day). Triple check that you have the right date/time on your calendar (especially if the school is in a different time zone from you.) *Then* ask for time off, explaining that a certain school has offered you an interview on a particular date.\n\n**Your next (logistical) steps:**\n\n* Plan out the logistics of interview day. Do you have somewhere with strong wifi, good lighting, somewhere you won’t be disturbed? Does your background look okay? \n* Contingency plans:\n   * Where would you go if that spot wasn’t available? Could you get there quickly?\n   * What would you do if the wifi dropped? (E.g. are you prepared to quickly switch over to a phone hotspot?)\n   * What would you do if you were interrupted? (You should have a sign on the door to minimize the odds of this.) Highly unlikely, but did in fact happen to me: what would you do if there was a fire drill? (Or another crisis?)\n* Do you have something nice to wear? Have you thought about hair/makeup? Do you have any visible tattoos/non-ear piercings? Do you need a haircut?\n   * Throughout the cycle, make sure you always have your interview outfit with you. I don’t care if it’s a holiday, a short trip - interview invites follow no rules and they will come when they come.\n* Make sure your zoom is updated to the latest version. *(This is your sign to do this now!)*\n* Check your application portal regularly - there may be forms to sign or info sessions to schedule before your interview date! They might not email you, so check at least (at least!) once per week up to your interview date.\n\n**FOR STANDARD (NON-MMI) INTERVIEWS:** \n\n**Normal ways to learn about the school:**\n\n* Skim their website, learn about their curriculum - don’t burn *too* much time doing this, it rarely comes up.\n* If you’re interested in research, track down the names of a few PIs you’d consider working with if admitted. If you’re interested in community service, look up some orgs. Definitely know the name of their free clinic (if they have one).\n* Many schools offer pre-interview info sessions, which are usually optional. Regardless of whether they track attendance, I figured it was worth an hour out of my evening to learn something about a school and potentially make a good impression, so I made a point of attending when possible.\n\n**My bizarre trick that ended up** ***really*** **paying off (I only did this for my top choice schools):**\n\n* I don't have any family members in medicine, so I felt that there was a lot of hidden curriculum I was missing. When I got my first interview invite, I reached out to a friend of a friend who was a current student at that school and learned a *ton* from our conversation - so as the ii's kept coming in, I kept reaching out to med students. I usually aimed for around 2-3 students per school.\n* I generally reached out over LinkedIn. Use up all your free LinkedIn messages, and sign up for a premium free trial if needed. The LinkedIn messages you send them need to be short (200 character limit).\n   * Here’s an example of one I sent to another alum from my school: \"Hi! I'm a former \\[mascot\\] (class of 2024) applying to med school. I just got an interview invite from \\[school\\] for \\[date\\]! If you're available, I'd love to chat. My number is \\[X\\]. Thanks!\"\n   * This is not a script so much as a guideline. Ideally, make sure you mention some connection you have to the person. Definitely include your interview date to convey that sense of urgency.\n   * Look for people from your undergrad, people who have worked the same jobs as you, won the same scholarships, played the same sport, run a club you'd hope to join, etc - just about any connection is fair game! (See “[The Strength of Weak Ties](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392)”)\n* When you meet with them - this is your chance to get your questions answered! *Come prepared* with anything you’re curious about, whether that’s about interview strategy, the school itself, the transition to med school, anything on your mind. This is also your chance to ask questions about the school that you might be uncomfortable asking on interview day.\n   * Remember - these are busy medical students! You’re asking for their time and offering nothing in return. Be polite! Make your gratitude clear!\n   * Sometimes the students you meet with will offer to connect you with other current students/organizations - when in doubt (especially if there’s still lots of time before your interview), the answer is “that would be great, thank you so much!”\n* Of all the questions I asked, these were the most high-yield (a term I fear is becoming a permanent fixture in my vocabulary). That said, there's no need to get through all of these, and feel free to add your own! Remember, the goal is to have a conversation where you learn something useful for interview day (and beyond), not a checkbox grill session.\n   * (If you’re told in advance who your interviewers are) Do you recognize these names?\n   * What is the institution most proud of about itself?\n   * What do I need to know in order to sound like I did my homework about the school? (Translation: what’s important about the school that might not be front-and-center on their website?)\n   * What about the school would you change if you could/did you have any hesitations about attending?\n   * (If they’re a current student/applied relatively recently) How was your interview day? What is the style of the interview? Any traps to watch out for?\n   * Why did you choose this school?\n   * How are you being affected by \\*gestures vaguely\\* everything going on right now? (Translation: how’s your school’s federal funding doing? What's happening with the shutdown/vaccines/reproductive care/gender-affirming care and their ability to teach about it? How has the school been handling any protests? Or any other recent shake-ups and/or scandals?)\n   * Other than finances, what do you think I should be weighing when choosing a school?\n   * Was your interviewer matched with you based on your application?\n   * (Last question) Anything else I should know? (They always say no - and then often share another nugget of info)\n* Many students end the call with “reach out if you have more questions!” or something along those lines. One person even offered to have me crash on their couch if I ended up visiting! *Make sure to jot this down in your notes!* You may end up speaking with a lot of people - remembering who offered to tour you around campus, buy you a coffee, help you weigh your options, etc, will be very useful down the line\n* In your interview, you can absolutely mention that you reached out to and met with current students! Independently meeting with students is not cheating - it's going above and beyond to (1) learn about the school and (2) demonstrate interest. Don't forget the names of who you spoke to, especially if you get a student interviewer (they're often curious, plus you'll get a chance to say nice things about their friends)\n\n**Practicing:** you can start this step any time - even before you get an invite! \n\nImportant questions to really nail (most important in italics):\n\n* *Tell me about yourself (no more than 2-3 min max)*\n* *Why medicine? (Bonus question: why MD/DO, and why not NP/PhD/something else in science/healthcare?)*\n* *Why are you interested in our school?*\n   * This is your chance to talk about the students you spoke to, the info sessions you attended, etc\n   * This question is in large part a vibe-check. Are you clearly enthusiastic about the prospect of attending their school, or are you just blandly listing off some student orgs/electives/etc that you found on their website?\n* *Tell me about a time when you…*\n   * *Faced/overcame a challenge*\n   * *Had an ethical dilemma*\n   * *Disagreed with someone (often the same as “ethical dilemma,” but worth prepping both)*\n   * *Worked on a team*\n* Tell me about \\[an activity\\]\n* Tell me about your research\n   * Rarely asked, but often blundered. Standard bad answer: \"I pipetted this reagent into that reagent, and then I ran this assay, and at the end of it all I got a figure and it had four lines on it.\"\n   * Use plain English and don't include extra details - I don't want to know the name of the alphabet-soup receptor you studied or signaling molecule I could go my whole career without ever hearing about. Assume that, if your interviewer wants to know some specific detail about your methods, they'll ask.\n   * My structure: basically an incredibly accessible abstract. (1) Open with the problem you're trying to solve/question you're trying to answer and *why I should care about it*. (2) Briefly (briefly!!) explain the methods and your role (lots of people forget to explain what they actually did). (3) Briefly explain the results and why they're interesting/exciting. Also mention any posters/pubs/etc. (4) Wrap up with future directions and/or big takeaways either for this research or for you as a researcher\n* How do you de-stress/tell me about a hobby\n* Describe your ideal career\n* What’s the biggest issue in medicine today? (Bonus question: and what needs to be done to address this issue?)\n   * If there's one specific type of inequity you wrote about in your application, you should be especially prepared to answer this question\n* *Questions for me?*\n   * This will almost certainly be the last question they ask - and you do need to have prepared questions!\n   * For interviewers who weren't students (faculty, adcoms, random people filling in), my go-to first question was \"what's your role in the medical school?\" Then I could ask questions from there - \"so what do you hope your students take away from their EM rotation?\" \"How do you feel about X new change in your field?\" etc\n   * Let go of the idea that you're asking questions to learn something. You're asking questions so your interviewer gets a chance to talk about something they're passionate about, and so they leave the interview with a positive impression of you.\n   * Do not ask questions like \"can you tell me about this one random club/lab/etc you've probably never heard of?\" You can absolutely ask hard questions - but don't just ask questions for the sake of asking them.\n   * My very last question was usually \"can I get your email address so I can send you a thank-you note?\" They almost always say yes, but some will ask you to send notes through the admissions office instead.\n\nThere are infinite lists of interview questions on the internet. I wasted a ton of time on them before realizing they were pretty useless since they were all variations on the same few questions anyways. Specifically, there are hundreds of versions of “tell me about a time when…” - but you really only need a handful of stories at the ready (the ones I listed above)\n\nYou can outline (outline! NOT script) in a google doc, but you'll see the most improvement from practicing OUT LOUD, ideally without your notes. So many things look okay in a google doc but sound dumb when you say them out loud. Practice in the shower, practice with your voice memos app, practice with your family/friends, practice with your cat - just make yourself actually say the words.\n\n**FOR MMI INTERVIEWS:**\n\n**Practicing:**\n\n* Suggested viewing - 10 min background on MMI (I have no affiliation with Dr. Ryan Gray): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjgJJtPNeiY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjgJJtPNeiY)\n* There are tons of MMI (multiple mini-interview) scenario compilations online - I’d suggest practicing talking through some of them, *on voice memos*. It will be painful to listen to these. It’s worth doing.\n* The most common weakness applicants have is inability to fill the time (generally 6-8 minutes). I’d aim to be comfortable speaking for 3-5 minutes, with the assumption that you’ll get asked follow-up questions by your interviewer.\n   * One thing that’s important to know is if the interviewers are instructed to ask follow-up questions if you finish early, or if they’ll just stare at you awkwardly until the timer runs out. You can generally find this info on SDN or by asking (or letting someone else ask) on interview day\n   * Also find out if you’re allowed to take notes - someone more neurotic than you will likely ask this on test day\n* Tracking down current students isn’t quite as important for this - but still worth considering meeting with 1-2 people so you have a sense of what you’re walking into\n\nMy structure for answering an MMI question:\n\n* Briefly restate the scenario (1-2 sentences max) - sometimes this is an item on the rubric so worth doing\n   * \"In this scenario, I'm the doctor for a patient who doesn't want a flu shot\"\n* If relevant, talk about the bioethical principles in conflict, and why\n   * \"Here, the principles of beneficence and autonomy are in conflict. As the physician, I want what's best for the patient's well-being - I want them to have a lower risk of catching the flu. But autonomy states that the patient should be able to make their own medical decisions and choose whether or not to consent to treatment, even if their providers disagree with them.\"\n* Lead with empathy, especially for scenarios around inequity/super painful decision-making\n* Leave your assumptions at the door. You don't have enough info to take a solid stance - you need to fill in some blanks to answer the question. But you need to *explicitly* say what blanks you're filling in! This is where you use lots of if/then statements.\n   * If the patient doesn't believe that vaccines work, then...\n   * If the patient is concerned about side effects, then...\n   * If the patient is uninsured and worries they can't afford the vaccine, then...\n   * If the patient is afraid of needles, then...\n   * (and so on)\n* Tie-up: don't just stop talking after you run out of if-thens. Wrap up with some sort of conclusion, whether that's about the empathy you feel for everyone in a very difficult situation, the principles in conflict, the need for more equitable healthcare access, etc\n\n**ALL INTERVIEW TYPES:**\n\n**On the day of:**\n\n* Make sure you’re well-rested for your interview and eat a good breakfast! \n* As for caffeine: I always felt too jittery even without caffeine, but if you’re not functional without it, it’s ok to have caffeine. You know your body best and I trust you to make the best decision - just make sure to account for the interview day nerves.\n* Bring your government-issued photo ID. Only one of the 22 interviews I attended asked for it (Stanford), but worth having just in case. Have your AAMC ID number on hand as well\n* Plug in your laptop! Earbuds on hand in case there’s an audio issue. Phone on do not disturb (but nearby in case there’s a zoom issue!)\n* Put up a sign on your door - “med school interview, done at X o’clock.” \n* How’s your wifi? Do you need to use your hotspot? How does your lighting look?\n* Show up early! (5-10 min should be okay)\n* Snacks and water at the ready (do NOT eat on camera, even if they say they won’t judge. Water is okay)\n* Do not have your notes up during the interview! The only acceptable notes to have is a list of the names of the students you spoke to, if relevant (if you’re worried you’ll forget their names)\n* There will likely be an icebreaker and/or “fun fact” question with the other applicants. This is low-stakes. Don’t overthink this\n* There will also likely be a few hours of info sessions/student panels. They will likely be a bit boring. Pay attention, ask good questions if you have them - don’t dominate the conversation, but it’s worth making your voice heard if you have something constructive to say/ask - you are probably being assessed by the adcoms\n* Do your best to make “eye contact” with the interviewer - this means you should look at the camera, not your interviewer's face! (It helped me to put their zoom box near the top of the screen)\n* Remember, that adrenaline you’re feeling isn’t anxiety - it’s excitement! You’re confident, you’re calm, you’re excited to be there! Breathe. *Smile*. You’ve got this!\n* Before leaving, check in with the adcom/administrator in the main zoom room that you’re good to go, and make sure to thank them for inviting you\n\n**Post-interview:**\n\n* If thank you notes for your interviewers aren’t *explicitly* not allowed, I’d send them - it’s just the nice thing to do. Ideally, they should be personalized (referencing something from your conversation) and reiterate your interest in the school. Will your note move the needle? Probably not. But your interviewers are largely volunteers and they deserved to be thanked for their time.\n* Definitely thank all the students who helped you prep for your interview! (A quick text/email/LinkedIn message will do)\n   * Let them know if you get in/get waitlisted too! They could be valuable resources and they deserve gratitude for their role in your application cycle\n\n**For those who don't already have enough anxiety in their lives**\n\nHere are the most difficult questions I got asked during my interviews:\n\n* \"It's clear you're incredibly intelligent. And I'm sure that's not the case for all of your classmates. I guess I'm just curious - what is it like for you? You spend all your time being around all these classmates who just can't keep up with you. It must be incredibly frustrating to be around people who are just... slow\"\n   * This felt super rehearsed - I think it was the adcom's way of screening out people who thought they were god's gift to premed\n   * I was definitely a bit flustered but I tried to respond with humility. I talked about how we all have strengths and weaknesses and I don't think I'm any better than my classmates, adding that if I found it frustrating to be around people who didn't understand scientific concepts then I wouldn't have worked as a science tutor\n* \"When I interviewed here a few years back, I'd already been to a few other interviews and was sitting on a T10 A, so I straight-up asked my interviewer why I should choose this school instead of the one I already got into. So if you're considering any other schools, I'd be happy to talk it through with you and help you weigh your choices\"\n   * Felt like a genuine offer from a student interviewer who was a very kind person (and a huge help to me in weighing my options after I was accepted) - but that question also felt like a trap\n   * I responded by thanking them and reiterating my interest in their school. Displaying anything other than excitement about the school I was interviewing at felt risky\n* \"Why didn't you say anything on your application about being URM? What do you mean you're not URM? Of course you are. What country did your parents immigrate from? What's their immigration status? Anyways, you should check out this program at my school for URM students.\"\n   * There are lots of questions that are wildly inappropriate for an interviewer to ask. You should not expect them. But you should probably prepare for them anyways\n   * [AAMC page on inappropriate interview questions](https://students-residents.aamc.org/medical-school-interviews/publication-chapters/your-interview-rights-responsibilities), with some examples and advice on how to respond\n\nGood luck!! I'll do my best to answer any questions!"

    "body": "**Just some comments I think would be helpful for me:**\n\n1. **Awards don't matter nearly as much as you think.** They’re very supplementary. They will not carry an application with red flags. Most people at Ivies don't have any major awards, if any at all. In fact, just because you have solid accomplishments (e.g., a grand award at ISEF, Olympiads) doesn't mean you're guaranteed admission. I know an AIME qualifier four years in a row who didn’t even get into our state flagship. Colleges care much more about your potential than what you’ve already done. Off the top of my head, I know five ISEF award winners, two STS semifinalists, and one person who was both an STS semifinalist and an ISEF grand award winner, none of whom got into a single T20 school.\n2. **Teacher recommendations and essays matter way more than you think.** A lot of Ivies and top schools use something called a \"personality score.\" (EDIT: not necessarily a personality score, but how well you would bond in their specific community as a person). I even know someone with a 1300 SAT and basically zero extracurriculars who got waitlisted at Harvard purely because of his teacher recs and essays. For more info, he didn’t even get into our state flagship either. State schools are much more stats based so it shows that academically, this person wasn't your traditional Harvard candidate, but still was put into the pool of potential candidates.\n3. **College applications aren't quantitative.** Just because someone gets into Harvard doesn’t mean they’ll get into Cornell. Similarly, just because someone with a profile similar to yours gets into Yale doesn’t mean you will too. And crucially, just because you don’t get into UMich doesn’t mean there’s no chance you'll get into an Ivy League school. I know 2 people at my school who got deferred from UMich but ended up at a HYPSM. I was also deferred from UMich, and I ended up getting into UPenn.\n4. **Don't let people get into your head as EA and RD results roll out.** When I didn’t get into UMich, someone who did get in had the audacity to come up to me and say, “Imagine doing all that work just to end up at your state flagship.” Like, I’m not the one paying $90K a year to attend an out-of-state public school (that was them)!! Honestly, I don’t think they meant it maliciously. They were probably just insecure because they had gotten rejected from CMU CS and a few other private schools that same day, and wanted to feel superior. Sometimes, it’s best to distance yourself from people during college application season, especially the day after Ivy Day.\n5. **Don't watch college reaction videos PLEASE.** They just make the process way more heartbreaking than it needs to be. Also, don’t record your reactions. It only adds to the emotional weight, and honestly, it gets depressing.\n6. **Your unweighted GPA matters a lot.** It shows whether you can handle the school's academic rigor, and it can sometimes (though not always) reflect the strength of your teacher recs. People with higher GPAs tend to have stronger recs because they’re often more hardworking and dedicated. Of course, that's not a hard rule, and there are exceptions.\n7. **Don’t apply to schools you’re not serious about attending.** Applications are competitive enough. If you get accepted somewhere you know you won’t go, *withdraw your application*. There are too many stressed-out waitlist kids out there for you to take up a spot you don't intend to fill.\n8. **A lot of people lie about college admissions.** Maybe this is just because I go to a competitive school, but it’s real. I know someone who lied about getting into Princeton, Yale, Harvard, and Columbia because they didn’t want to be judged by underclassmen and also fellow classmates. Also, people love to downplay others' success - comments like \"they were just a diversity pick\" or \"Cornell isn’t a real Ivy\" are common (anecdotes from my sister after she committed to Cornell lol).\n9. **People will try to tear you down.** I thought it was just my school, but at UPenn admitted students day, I found out that 3 out of 4 people at my lunch table had someone try to blacklist them from colleges. One person even said someone wrote an entire essay trashing them and sent it to every school they applied to. Colleges are used to this kind of thing. It usually gets deleted or forwarded to your school administration to verify. Also, admissions officers who actually make decisions don't even see this stuff so don't worry. Your chances are not ruined.\n10. **It’s normal to get into only one school.** UPenn was the only T20 I got into. I didn’t get into UMich (a T30), Northwestern (which usually takes a good number of people from my school), or even WashU - all schools that are statistically less selective, but still amazing schools. I also know someone where Yale was the only school they got into (after getting rejected from Princeton REA, which usually has a pretty high deferral rate). It sucks, but don’t freak out. College applications are genuinely such a headache and very random.\n11. **Don’t compare your profile to others on ChanceMe or CollegeResults.** What worked for someone else won’t necessarily work for you. Colleges weigh your background heavily. Someone from a rural area doing research and scoring a 1400 SAT could absolutely get into Harvard. But at a school like TJHSST, you're expected to do much much more given your regional competition.\n\nI’m probably missing a few more points, but these are my main takeaways for now."

But, I do believe it is my fault.\n\nHere are my statistics:\n\n\\-Test scores so far: 36 composite ACT - 36 reading, 35 math, 36 english, 36 science // 1530 SAT - 790 math, 740 english // 5s on 9/9 taken APs so far: bio, cs principles, cs a, chem, world history, human geo, statistics, calc ab, eng lang // 4.0 unweighted GPA\n\n\\-Extracurriculars: captain of boys varsity golf team sophomore through senior year - advanced to state competition freshman and sophomore year individually and as a team junior and senior year - placed T8th and T7th as a team junior and senior years // played a bunch of individual tournaments around the country - AJGA, FJT, etc. and placed well in some of them // member of national honor society student philanthropy council - 2 $5k grants donated to mental health community orgs. then 20 hr volunteering for NAMI // 100 volunteer hours for the First Tee organization, aiding juniors // was vice pres and treasure for school DECA club - went to states 10th, 11th, and 12th grade // cofounded both the computer science club and science national honor society chapter at my school for senior year // member of math national honor society, the spanish national honor society, and the national honor society\n\n\\-Honors: National merit finalist, AP scholar with distinction, student of the year for freshman year, honor roll all \"A\"s throughout high school\n\n\\-Class rank: 2/370\n\n\\-Went to a fairly good rated public school for four years of high school\n\n\\-Am a white middle class male\n\n  \nHeres where I faulter: I applied to UCF, FSU, UF, Vanderbilt, Duke, Dartmouth, Princeton, and Yale. No EDs, just regular decisions. I applied neuroscience academic interest for all these schools. Decisions: accepted to UCF, FSU, and UF, rejected from Duke, Dartmouth, Princeton, yale, and waitlisted from Vanderbilt.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have applied to more colleges. I should have applied to some better out of state schools, instead of just going for the \"best of the best\". I was foolish and ignorant in terms of what I thought I could get into, and did not do enough research on college admissions. I also should have ED'd, likely to Duke, had I known the acceptances for ED was easier. Additionally, I did not really know what major I was going to do in college, and therefore many of my extracurriculars do not match the neuroscience avenue I had listed. Moreover, I clicked \"I wish not to have alumni interviews\" on all my colleges. I do not know why.\n\nI also believe my essays were lackluster. My life has been fostered greatly by my parents. I have been fortunate not to have had any traumatic events yet. To note, I had no outside guidance on my essays. Therefore, I wrote my commonapp essay on golf, and my inherent struggle with keeping up to scoring expectations, which have substantially affected my golf game. My specific essays for the colleges were also all over the place. I did not have a clear sense of who I was, except that I had played golf all my life, loved family and friends, and loved science.\n\nIm going to attend UF in the summer. I should be happy for it, but im not. I feel like something is missing, like Im going down a road I wish not to go down. I dont want to feel like I'm being pretentious, but it feels like the work I have put in to get to these colleges did not mean anything at all. And I cant see past it. Additionally, I know some other people who were accepted into UF with statistics that, at least in my eyes, were less good than mine. And this sentiment has been thoroughly pointed out by many outsiders, my mother, and some of my classmates (\"How did you not get into a better school?\"). I know comparison is the thief of joy, but there is no more joy. I want to keep a positive attitude. I know its the right thing to do. But I just cant. I'm slipping, I can feel it. This is the one thing that I had geared my whole life towards, and I amounted nothing.\n\nMy mom cried tonight. I am writing this post in response to that.\n\nThanks for reading my rant.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I appreciate the responses from everyone. If it adds to anything, I am able to attend UF free of cost, of which I am extremely grateful for. I did receive a full ride scholarship to any out of state school as well, which is unfortunate I cannot use for any school. But attending UF with no cost is something I am fully appreciative of. \n\nI was in a less than ideal mental state writing this post, but I most certainly feel better after reading everyone’s responses. I look forward to UF now, even if I wasn’t accepted to the honors program first year. But I am most certainly up for the idea of transferring, or just putting in a good 4 years in a preparation for graduate school.\n\nOverall, my expectations for college admissions speak to entitlement, and it’s a lesson learned. I will work to create realistic ideals in my life, and to try to stay positive, both now and for the future. Thanks for all y’all’s input, I sincerely appreciate it."

    "body": "This will be a longer post (but hopefully not too long) with a TLDR at the end.\n\nSo I graduated last spring, but while I was there, I remember a faculty member telling me that the engineering program was trying to lessen the gen ed requirements for arts and humanities so their students can spend more time on engineering courses. The requirements are that every student has to take 9 credits of arts and humanities combined, but at least 3 credits had to come from each area (so 3 credits in art and 6 credits in humanities, or 3 credits in humanities and 6 credits in art). Apparently, the engineering programs thought that that was too much for their students to handle, and so they should only have to take 6 credits. You’ll notice that I value the arts and humanities based on my flair and the title of this post, but still, it seems absurd to me that engineering students would somehow be hindered in their studies by taking 9 credits of them.\n\nHere’s the deal: the 9 credits combined requirement is already a concession when comparing that to some of the gen ed requirements for other fields (7 natural science credits, one of which must be a lab credit; 6 social science credits, which includes history, political science, etc.; 6 credits of writing, plus 3 credits of speaking). Math is somehow also getting shafted with only 3 credits being required, and logic (a philosophy class) counts towards that. There are some “more advanced” gen ed requirements that may or may not add to the amount of sciences and arts/humanities that you take, but they also let you double dip for fulfilling requirements (so one class may fulfill two separate categories in the requirements).\n\nMy complaint about it is that the arts and humanities are important for personal development/growth, so reducing the requirements even further takes away from that. I see a pretty detrimental lack of ability or willingness in many of my peers to critically think about things, and in a democratic society, that can be a fatal flaw. Just because social sciences, arts, and humanities aren’t as marketable as STEM majors, that doesn’t make them less valuable.\n\nIf I was designing a list of gen ed requirements, it would look something more like this: 6 credits in art (can be music/music history, drawing, theater, etc.), 6 credits in humanities, 6 credits in social science, 6 credits in history (this is separate from humanities on purpose), 7 credits in natural science (1 from a lab), 6 credits in math (not including logic; that should go back to the humanities), and 6 credits in english (3 of which should come from a writing-specific class; the other 3 should be more focused on discussion/analysis of literature). That totals 43 credits, leaving 77 credits for whatever major(s) and minor(s) people want to pursue. I would be fine with the gen ed requirements also counting towards your major and minor if applicable.\n\nSo what do you guys think?\n\nTLDR: I feel that the arts and humanities aren’t valued enough by a lot of people and universities, and I’d like to change gen ed requirements to increase exposure to those areas. See above for the paragraph discussing those in detail."

That is reserved for the specific program itself that determines that.\n\nThis is not like undergraduate applications where it is a school that reviews numbers, stats, etc., which there is already a sub for that at /chanceme\n\nGraduate school applications are a way different process, in which a program admission committee OR a specific faculty PI is the one that determines your admission to their program. A lot of the time, there are more qualified applicants than there are spots (i.e., 300 applications for 5-10 spots)\n\nIf you want to personally chance yourself with grad admission:\n\n1. Go into the program website you are interested in, and see if they have any stats from their accepted students (a lot of PhD programs do that, not sure about Masters)\n2. If you can't find it, reach out to the program itself and ask if there is a stats of their students\n3. Reach out to the program if they can give advice\n4. Research specific programs, go learn and find a faculty whose research you want to work with, if they have a research website, they most likely will have information on whether they want to be emailed before application or not (some will say yes, some will say no)\n5. Ask your professors at your university for help, utilize your writing centers, etc., ask them to read your information and experiences and what you can do to improve to be competitive for graduate programs\n\nOnce again, we all will NOT be able to give you an answer on your chances into a graduate program no matter the stats you give us. Fit within a program matters a lot and they are the only ones that determines your fit in their program.\n\nMost likely, we will give you compliments on your achievements and say good luck and that your chances are good or that you need more research experience related to what you want to do.\n\nBut I still wish everyone all the best while waiting for decisions in the next couple of months!"

    "body": "After seeing a lot of rejection posts, maybe I will briefly share my experience this cycle and my limited advice.\n\nAround my sophomore year of college, I became incredibly passionate about the application of deep learning for engineering and modeling biological systems and had made the decision to apply to PhD programs to further explore this passion.\n\n  \nI did not apply to PhD programs because of a specific faculty member or even because of the research I was doing in the lab I was working in(which was a biological wet lab and less relevant to machine learning), but rather because of a passion that was curated from reading books and taking on self-initiated projects in this field, and in turn I ended up curating my own unique, niche, and ambitious research vision.\n\n  \nCome around senior year, I applied to 14 PhD programs, with a 4.0 GPA in biomedical engineering, multiple years of research experiences and data science internships each summer at large companies like GE Healthcare. Yet after interviewing at top schools like Johns Hopkins, USC, UCSD, and more, I eventually and have finally been rejected from all 14 PhD programs I applied to.\n\nAs much as I could blame the current funding situation which would not be unreasonable to blame, my best guess after a lot of reflection was that I simply had no good fit. I was passionate about the research interests and projects I had in mind, but there were no faculty that I believe were truly doing what I believe needed to be done in this field. I had a subconscious hope that when I start my PhD I can adapt a project to fit my unique interests, but after over 20 interviews, I got the impression that for the most part PhD students are at the disposal of the research interests and grants a PI applies for with some but not extreme flexibility(although this depends on the program slightly). In turn, fit becomes everything.\n\nI applied to PhD programs and mentioned faculty with maybe a 60-70% fit to my interests but I knew in my heart when applying that the right alignment was not there but continued regardless. During interviews it is of course nearly impossible to fake or pretend to be interested and engaged in the exact research interests during 1 on 1s with faculty.\n\n  \nMaybe I am wrong, but the advice I would give is being passionate about research or a field, having relevant qualifications is no where near enough, if you are not passionate or deeply aligned with what faculty members are actually doing and the exact priorities of a program, the likelihood of admissions remains extremely low. \n\nA PhD is not like a job, where you can be half interested in what a company is doing but are looking to deepen and expand your skills for further opportunities down the line and have the perfect qualifications for the job. In fact it is the opposite, from my experience you could have half the qualifications necessary, but the perfect fit for a program, and the likelihood of admission would be significantly higher."

That said, a few schools were closed when I tried calling. If there’s a specific college you’d like me to reach out to, drop a comment or DM me — I’m happy to make a call and update this post. Give a few days tho since Im going to be on a flight (Im actually posting this on the drive to the airport rn LMAO) Now, without further ado, here’s the full list of schools I contacted:\n\nSTANFORD: everyone will get a decision by today. \n\nBROWN: The waitlist is still open, and going on a rolling basis admissions until mid july / next few weeks. Theres nothing specifically they look for since waitlisted students already meet the criteria. Refused to give any numbers on how many were accepted. \n\nCARNEGIE MELLON: Carnegie melon has no waitlist movement right now and i don’t think theyre anticipating a lot? (Just the way it sounded) but theyre keeping the waitlist open. They also admit on a rolling, individual basis. UPDATE: was just informed that the CMU waitlist closed \n\nHARVARD: no news is good news. if youre not rejected from the waitlist yet. that means you’re still in active consideration. There is no ranking whatsoever and its very sporadic based on what they need, admitting on an individual basis. LOCIS are always appreciated, even now! Those last minute details can be the deciding factor. Any news whatsoever will come through the portal so always keep an eye on it\n\nDUKE: they’re virtually pretty much closed, as June is about to end.\n\nBOSTON COLLEGE:  They accepted a decent amount of waitlist students among all four schools already. Their class is pretty full so they dont have any immediate plans to pull off the waitlist. However, It is up in the air and a definite possibility based on extenuating circumstances and other college waitlist movement. The college of arts and sciences is a good place to be in for a waitlisted candidate because its the largest school so they often pull from there. They dont look for any candidate specifically BUT you should definitely reach out to the regional admissions counselor on your portal to let them know you’re still interested in boston college, and that you’re doing well academically and whatnot. Acceptances are usually in waves. \n\nCOLBY COLLEGE: they are still open & working on the waitlist, rolling vs waves depends when a student says they dont want to go to colby and theyll look to the waitlist instead (im assuming this means rolling). Nothing particular they look for, well rounded applicants mostly. They look at grades, community service, maybe some certifications that the student is working on\n\nUC BERKELEY: The person i talked to said waitlist won't officially be closed until august 1st, but according to [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucadmissions/comments/1llko0d/uc_berkeley_waitlist_update/), a very small number of people will be taken off waitlist only from L&S \n\nWELLESLEY: The waitlist is not officially closed until aug 1 but they are not expecting to take anyone off bc they've reached their target class size.\n\n\nUCSD: Theyre gonna keep it going until mid-late august and anticipate more acceptances. They do it on a rolling basis and theres not much they look so the most that waitlisted students can do is just wait. They admitted a fair few off but the person who picked up didnt have any specifics \n\nUF: no updates have been given but theyre still open and still making decisions. It seems a bit unorganized, especially since this is the first year they’ve even had a waitlist. That said, they review all applicants holistically based on their current needs, so it seems like decisions are being made on more of a rolling basis.\n\nUNC CHAPEL HILL: closing today, all decisions will be in by tmrw\n\nCORNELL GENERAL ADMISSIONS: so they dont have specific rejection info but each admissions office for each college is separate. So the rejections are most likely random and not systematic since theyre not conferring (my interpretation). They plan to make the waitlist go late this year so as far as she knows yes there will be more acceptances and the thing to do now is submit updates because the admissions offices will be sorting by most recently updated first\n\nCORNELL COLLEGE OF HUMAN ECOLOGY: They’re not sure how many more theyrr anticipating but will send decisions once theyre available, if no rejection yet = theyre still anticipating more acceptances. Rolling vs waves depends on a lot of factors so its not one or the other. Cornell had a fair amount of waitlist movement in general this year, no specific numbers on ecology since it depends on what the accepted student body looks like. In loci: express how you hope to use your intended major and why the cornell college of ecology specifically is important to you\n\nNORTHWESTERN: waitlist process is still ongoing, didn't get any more info other than that\n\nUCHICAGO: Haven’t closed the waitlist yet, cuz they still anticipate potentially activating it but its kind of a “wait and see” type scenario rn because theyre not really sure. They dont admit in cohorts so they go on a rolling/individual basis and they dont look for anything SPECIFIC, but they do look for who seems the brightest/passionate and demonstrated interest is something they value in the waitlist since they want students who raised their hand and showed that they truly love uchicago\n\nHAMILTON: theyre still active and open and accepting people. they accept in waves as slots open up and they accept based on what their current class needs but nothing in specific\n\nTUFTS: They’re pretty much closed already, and everything will be finalized this week. \n\nUMIAMI: theres no ranking system or anything they look for.  They’ve had a fair amount of admissions this year off the waitlist but no exact numbers\n\nUVA: The waitlist is still open with no projected closing date. There might still be some anticipated acceptances, but there’s no certainty around how many—if any—will be offered. It depends on their needs, so decisions could be released in waves or on a rolling basis. The only confirmed info right now is that the waitlist remains open, and they’re still deciding whether they’ll extend more offers. It’s a bit of a waiting game since they never really know how many spots will open up.\n\nBARNARD COLLEGE OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: yes theyre still making waitlist acceptances until an email is sent to them confirming its closed. they accept off of a rolling basis and one thing they DO want to emphasize is that they are need aware for waitlisted candidates but they do NOT recmmend waiving finaid bc its very important for students. Im an incoming Barnard freshman and hope u all get off <3\n\nAgain, if you have a college you want me to call, comment or dm me and I’ll get back to you after my plane lands. Genuinely, it’s been such a honor, but I unfortunately have a life and multiple jobs. There are times where I’m meeting someone new and they’re like “oh you’re the waitlist kid!” Good luck to everyone and thank yall for everything <3\n-OkEgg\n-Barnard College, Columbia University ‘29"

    "body": "hi y'all! first post in this thread, please be gentle;\n\nContext: I'm a senior at a T20 undergrad and applied to around 35-40 schools. In all, I received 10 IIs that have since turned into 7 WLs and 3 A's. Of those 7 WL's, two are T20 and out of the 3 As, one is 1-2 tier while the other is mid-tier. I'm leaning towards the mid-tier school and have spoken to many current students there and am really, really loving it. I am absolutely grateful for how my cycle has gone and *cried* when I heard my first A.\n\nHowever, it has been breaking my heart that my parents don't understand how much this means to me. We had a conversation where I brought up my fears about feeling like they're disappointed in me or that I didn't do good enough...and they just reaffirmed those fears. I'll be the first in my immediate family to attend med school and navigated this process mostly through (shoutout to this subreddit) upperclassmen and extremely kind, amazing mentors I met along the way. I can tell that my parents don't think highly of this accomplishment because my A's weren't T20, and the school I love and am considering committing to is mid-tier. I've tried explaining that I am in a really fortunate position, that some of my peers have no A's right now and that it is increasingly hard it is to get into medical school, *period*, with each school's rate being around 2% - statistically much harder than when I applied to undergrad. I've told them about how this school's match rate is fantastic and how the current students love the collaboration there and see such a diversity of patients and cases.\n\nIt's not just them. When other peers ask how everything's going and where I've gotten offers from, I tell them, and I can see a pause as they evaluate how good they think those programs are. No enthusiasm but rather a polite awkward smile as they don't immediately recognize the name of the school, but if I mention the II or WL at the T10, they immediately praise that institution.\n\nAt my undergrad, there's many highly privileged prestige-chasing students. I have a friend who's CS from the Bay Area. When he would ask about how a test or class went, and I replied that it didn't go great, he would often say it was a \"skill issue\" or an \"L\" and that the class was so easy, which I would brush off as jokes. I grew up in an underserved, rural area where making it *to college* was considered an accomplishment and dream, in and of itself. I came into college with no background in STEM classes aside from self-studying, whereas some peers had taken orgo 2 in high school already, and struggle-bussed my way through gen chem. He doesn't understand that not everyone was surrounded by the best financial and educational resources in their upbringing like he was and how circumstances can influence a multitude of things. He has made many condescending remarks about when I didn't excel in a course or do something that he thinks is expected/easy (even though he isn't premed). He'll say things like maybe he'll become a doctor someday too or take the MCAT \"for fun.\"\n\nTonight, we got dinner together, and he asked how many acceptances I have gotten. I told him, and he replied, \"Only 3???\" and looked shocked. Then, he proceeded to list off names to guess where my 3 were: \"NYU?\" \"Johns Hopkins?\" \"UCLA?\" I told him how 3 was an amazing spot to be in and how there are people I know who don't have any right now because the cycle is just unpredictable and harsh, no matter who's applying. He just shook his head and changed topics. Yes, name-brand prestige is nice but is it the *only* thing that matters? Must we trivialize everyone and everything else if they do not fit into this box? His comments set off this rant about people who only care about prestige and assign worth based solely on prestige.\n\nI hate how I feel like I have to *prove* something to these people who know nothing about this path, and specifically, the path it's taken me to get here. (Side tangent, I took physics at my school *after* I took the MCAT, and the grading was rough. Parent asked about how I was doing in it, I said that it's been hard, but I've been doing okay above-average scores on exams. She sighed. I explained that it's notorious for being one of the worst STEM classes at my school (beyond orgo/biochem, etc) and that it's not a reflection of my capabilities in physics. I self-studied for the MCAT without ever having taken a physics course (hs didn't offer) and got a 131 on C/P. Parent joked that it was because MCAT C/P was easy. I'm tired of feeling like I must *constantly* *prove* how hard I've worked to get where I am, even with the MCAT or grades. To have to prove that I didn't do well on the MCAT from some fluke, but rather because I worked my way up. To prove that I am capable. To prove.)\n\nI'm tired of having to defend my accomplishments like they're something to be ashamed of or hide, and I'm trying to not let their words get to me, but it hurts. I hate how it makes me feel like I somehow failed, despite having 3 MD A's. Their comments make me feel like I didn't do good enough, that I let them down. Is getting *into* med school not a difficult achievement itself, not something to celebrate or be proud of?? I hate that their comments get to me sometimes, and it's been a constant battle to hold steady to my self-validation.\n\ntldr; I'm exhausted from trying to stay proud of my hard-work and achievements without being torn down by other people who think the only things that one can accomplish are prestige for the sake of prestige.\n\nAny advice on how to deal with this? (and my friend's comments). Apologies for the redundancy. All insights or reassurances are welcome too :) thanks for reading my lengthy rant !!\n\n*edited for concision*\n\nedit2: **honestly thank y'all so much for the kind words, support, and insights! I appreciate the guidance and feel such a strong sense of community with everyone in this thread, y'all are such sweet, wonderful humans that make me feel so hopeful for medicine.**\n\nSince posting this, I've reflected a lot more on what do I truly want to be remembered for? When I'm gone someday? And it is indeed not prestige - it's never been. I've also come to really see that instead of searching for answers within myself to their criticisms, I should recognize that they're not my issues to solve - people's words/behavior are a reflection of *their* character and values. I've been working on strengthening boundaries a lot this year and definitely still have a long way to go and will certainly keep y'all's wisdom and advice close to heart :)\n\nif I don't get through replying to all the comments, please know I appreciate it so so so much!! thank you!!!"

    "body": "Hey y'all! Most folks who talk about how to study in preclinicals are people still in preclinicals who haven't taken step. I want to share my perspective for incoming students as someone several months into clinicals and post-step 1, and who is verifiably stupid as fuck. Some of what I have here is advice I was given, a lot is stuff I've added to myself. Forewarning, YMMV,  everyone is individual, no school is the same yada yada:\n\n\\-find the resource that works well for you, explains things in depth, and (most important) explains in a way where you  can teach an adult with lower education levels who doesn’t trust you/ want to listen for long because they’re used to doctors making them feel stupid (or not telling them what’s going on outright). That underlying understanding is imperative to pass step, to do well in clinicals, and (again, most important) be able to help your patients understand what they’re going through.\n\n\\- do anki like it’s religion, and if you don’t understand the card, quickly relearn it (Amboss add-on slays here). I hated anki, did not use it for the MCAT, suspended the whole thing after my first block in preclinicals. Then restarted because it was even worse without it. Often in clinicals the only reason I know what’s going on is because of a random anki recall when I thought there was no point in learning it. I’d say 90% of pimp Q’s I’ve gotten right is because of remembering an anki card, but 100% of the things I’ve done right (suggesting tests to order, notes to write, explanations to patients) have been from understanding WHY the anki card says what it says. Understanding is keyyyyyy.\n\n\\- preclinicals is about getting an in-depth understanding of underlying processes and mechanisms of path/phsyio (why the thing is happening, why the tx works). Clinicals is learning what to do with that knowledge (recognizing in person vs question stem, tests to run to verify, etc). If your school is focusing hard on the latter part (what to do), it means you’re missing out on the first half which is MUCH more important for your success in all realms.\n\n\\- step has moved away from basic recall and buzz words, and fully into in-depth understanding paired with heinously specific recalls, so older resources that are focused on recalling generic phrases with direct answers vs deep understanding are no longer enough.\n\n\\- At my school, people who did bootcamp have all taken step within 10 weeks of preclinicals and passed first try (usual combo was bootcamp + sketchy + AnKing). Most people who did BnB or pathoma only (with or without AnKing and sketchy) had to delay, but none failed. For folks who did only classwork, while some have taken it and passed, 8 have failed (roughly 5% of our total class, which is probably 10-15% of the folks who did classwork only). Everyone left who has not taken it at this point (6 months out from preclinicals) are those who did only class work.\n\n**Tl;dr:**\n\n\\- do stuff to understand\n\n\\- be able to explain at kindergarten level\n\n\\- pound anki, it’s an abusive/ love-hate relationship but it’s worth it\n\n\\- remember the goal is to do this with a human first and foremost. Don't forget the humanity of it in the process\n\n**Specific resources and their descriptions for you:**\n\n*please everyone do not buy resources if you don't know whether they will work for you. Any school you go to usually has the class above you hand down something to \\*ahem\\* \\~figure out\\~ what works for you when it comes to third party. I'm a first-gen nontrad living entirely on loans, so I'm happy to answer questions on figuring out costs/ balancing budget on these all.* \n\n1. Bootcamp: my lord and savior Dr. Roviso... I will proselytize about bootcamp, and I often cite them as the only reason I got through preclinicals and passed step as fast as I did. They take the complicated mumbo-jumbo and break it down to a VERY basic level to make sure you really understand, have slides you can download to write on, but then also sit there and draw it out for you on the page during the video (hit the full trifecta of learning styles with visual, auditory, and tactile). The videos are split up (i.e. 45 minuite section broken into five 9min videos) with little practice questions in between for understanding. They also have a chat function where you can message at any point and a real human responds and helps you with whatever you're not understanding. The videos also include the speaker's face/ room around them while recording, which is nice because med school studying is horrifyingly lonely and it's comforting to see another person's face there talking to you. Not horribly expensive, comparatively to failing and retaking step (I think bootcamp was like... $400 for two years? idk if that's changed. Step is $680 per take currently). They also have a 3 days free trial where you will get hooked. They aren't paying me to say this, I just love them and everyone who's joined since I've told them has too. 10/10 resource.\n2. AnKing: very very good for recall and plugging in. FSRS is life saving. Do NOT simply do cards to memorize, think through to understand. People will brag about their 6s per card... please don't do this. Read the card, think of the answer, then double check you understand WHY the card says what it says. If you catch yourself memorizing the shape of the sentence, alternate between window sizes, which changes the sentence shape (fulls screen, tall and narrow, short and fat, etc). I think there's a free version (v11, doesn't have bootcamp tags, some incorrect answers), or you can pay $5 for a month's subscription, download the v12 deck (updated answers and tags) and just not renew so you keep the deck. 9/10 resource, minus 1 bc I often have to rephrase their cards to dumb it down for myself.\n3. Sketchy: Use for bugs/drugs. When you feel like you can't shove more info in your brain, sit back and watch a cartoon. They're more expensive than I personally like, and unfortunately they're cracking down netflix-style on the people who are trying to do right and pay them but can't afford the cost on their own so are splitting between friends. That said, invaluable resource. As step is starting to change, not as in depth as you end up needing for step but still thorough enough with the memory devices that you can get there if you understand. 8/10 resource.\n4. UW: controversial opinion, but I think their question bank is only useful for preclinicals and not for dedicated. They do a great job of making sure you have an understanding of the disease and why the questions and answers connect (or don't connect), but they do not teach your NBME logic at all (i.e. when I was getting 90s in UW, I was getting 50s on NBME... then when I bumped up to 70s in NBME I was getting 20-30% in UW because the thought process is so different). I personally think folks should have and use this during preclinicals as a learning tool. Please do not pay attention to the score, pay attention to why the diseases are what they are, why they aren't the other options, and how to differentiate given various clues. 10/10 for preclinicals, 3/10 for dedicated.\n5. Pixorize: like sketchy, but only good for biochem. No idea what this costs tbh.... 10/10 resource for biochem, 3/10 resource for everything else\n6. Pathoma: Excellent at dumbing it down, but often reliant on scripts for illnesses/ diseases that can be hard if you don't fully understand in depth. That makes it a fantastic resource when you hit dedicated, and it's cheap cheap when it boils down to it in the end. $50 i think, and they send you a workbook and physical text when you get it. 6/10 resource for preclinicals, 10/10 resource when it comes to dedicated for step 1.\n7. Dirty Medicine Biochemistry: Free youtube resource (you love to see it). My guy runs you through an entire disease process and differential with memory aids, and will dumb it down. Fantastic resource BUT often not in enough depth for in-house exams. 6/10 preclinicals, 10/10 dedicated\n8. Boards and Beyond (BnB): Pretty sure this is the resource that was sold to a fancy (predatory) company who charges an arm and a leg for videos, and the dude who made it tried to get someone kicked out of residency for pirating. With that, the people who love this resource are the people who are smart enough to see 5 bullet points per slide and understand a disease. That person is not me, I am too stupid for that, but there are definitely those of you out there whose brains are BIG. For those people, this resource is probably 9/10. For the rest of us, this resource is probably a 5/10, EXCEPT cardio which is 8.5/10. He's a cardiologist and the cardio absolutely slays here.\n9. First Aid: I don't know why people keep recommending this as a learning resource, because it is not. It is a checklist to see if you hit the major things you need to know. It basically lists the diseases with a bunch of bullet points of the facts with no explanation. I had mannnnnnnny questions on step where the disease wasn't even touched on in first aid, let alone the process step asked about (I double checked after my test). Good to check off whether you have the info you need (8/10), but otherwise not helpful for learning (2/10)."

    "body": "Hey everyone, here’s some advice I wish I had when I was applying to college! I was fortunate to get in to Cornell, Duke, West Point, NYU, and UMich this year, and I want to pass along what I learned—especially for those of you applying in Fall '25.\n\n**1. Start early.**  \nI began my applications in October. Big mistake. That’s *very* late, especially when you’re dealing with personal essays, a mountain of supplements, and, if you're applying to West Point, the absolute gauntlet of that process. **Start in September.** Trust me, it’ll save ur sanity.\n\n**2. The “don’t write about sports” myth is... a myth.**  \nI wrote about sports—and it worked. But here’s the key: don’t write about the *sport*, write about *yourself*. Use the sport as a metaphor, a backdrop. Don’t list your accolades (save that for the activities section or your resume). Focus on how the experience shaped your mindset, your struggles, your growth. Also: don’t get so caught up in flowery imagery that you lose the point. This goes for all personal essays, not just “sports” ones. Substance over style. Write with heart.\n\n**3. Your extracurriculars don’t have to scream your major.**  \nMost of my ECs weren’t tied to my intended major. I got into the College of Arts & Sciences at every school I applied to without a portfolio, without research, and with only one related activity (Olympiad, where I made it to the state championship level). What I *did* have was a ton of leadership. So don’t stress if your resume isn’t hyper-specialized, just show depth, initiative, and commitment.\n\n**4. Supplements matter—don’t play it safe.**  \nPLEASE don’t just name-drop a professor or program and call it a day. That’s bland and forgettable. Be original. Be funny, if that fits your style. Make it *you*. Tie it all back to your identity, your goals, your voice. Your supplements should feel like an extension of who you are, not a research paper.\n\n**5. Have a strong resume.**  \nYou don’t get many opportunities to list all your achievements on the Common App, especially when it comes to honors and awards. A well-formatted resume can fill in those gaps and help admissions officers see the full picture. Definitely worth having.\n\nGood luck to all of you applying! Take it seriously, but don’t be afraid to let your personality shine. You’re not just applying to college! you’re telling your story. Make it count.\n\n**6. Take interviews seriously but be human.**  \nWhether it’s for alumni interviews or scholarships, don’t just memorize answers. Know your story. Be honest. If you’re asked what you’d change about your school, don’t say “nothing” to be polite. Say something real and constructive, authenticity sticks, and be normal.\n\n**7. Letters of recommendation: choose people who know you** ***well***\\*\\*.\\*\\*  \nIt’s better to have a teacher who saw your growth, effort, and character than one with a fancy title who barely remembers your name. Also, ask early. Like, junior spring or early senior fall. And give them a brag sheet or resume so they can write a detailed letter.\n\n**8. Don’t obsess over prestige.**  \nYes, name matters, but so does fit. A “lower-ranked” school with the right community, programs, and mentorship opportunities can do more for you than a brand name where you’re miserable or lost in the crowd. Go where you can thrive.\n\n**9. Use the Additional Info section wisely.**  \nIf there’s something important you couldn’t fit into the app context about your school, a unique EC, or a life challenge, this is where to mention it. Keep it short, clear, and relevant. Please don’t waste it on filler.\n\n**10. You don’t need to be perfect.**  \nA few B’s won’t ruin your chances. You don’t need a 1600. You don’t need 10 internships. Just show that you’re driven, reflective, and passionate. Schools are PEOPLE!!! Stop looking at those fake ass instagram reels. I GOT IN WITH 2 STATE AWARDS!\n\n"

I (31 NB/AMAB) was laid off from my job (as part of a mass layoff) at an F500 a few months back (July) and have been doing some soul searching in the time since.  \n\nSo this has been my path so far:\n- AA from HCC (finished)\n- BA from UH (finished)\n- MS from Liberty University (dropped out for moral reasons)\n- 5 years at F500 company as an IT analyst\n- MS from BU (in progress, expected December 2025)\n- MA from ASU (incoming January 2026)\n\nI started to remember how much I enjoyed political science, specifically, a field that I now know is called political psychology.  What I found the most interesting about this field is the exploration of why people think, vote and believe the ways that they do (as a Texan, this especially applies to my neighbors). I also realized that a major reason for why I chose to go for a Master's in Data Science at BU was implicitly because one of my poli sci professors at UH mentioned the importance of a good quant foundation as a political scientist.\n\nI realized how years of attempting to please my parents led me to, first, go to Liberty University (a school I never wanted to go to) and work a corporate job.  I might still have a house and I might have gotten experience, but it cost me my mental and physical health, as well as a deep sense of regret that my parents losing their home (during the year that I graduated) led me to this state of survival to the point that I lost all sense of my own humanity.\n\nSo, yeah, even with the job market being what it is, my personal circumstances, et al. I applied to three programs - all online because, as being me in Texas, I wanted to make sure that I could flee anywhere if necessary, even though this is my home state.\n\nThen this happened:\n\nFriday (September 12) - I changed course on my capstone project for the MSDS and started modeling on hate speech datasets.\n\nSaturday (September 13) - I got my first admit to IU Online and spent the day imagining myself as an IU alumni with an MA in Political Science.\n\nMonday (September 15) - I got my second admit to ASU, which was my target, and stalked LinkedIn profiles of IU and ASU grads, and found that the ASU grads seemed to be doing pretty well for themselves. Then, I proceeded to imagine myself as an MA in Political Psychology graduate and liked that vision, especially since this is what I want to specialize in, if nothing else.\n\nI also saw that ASU Online has plenty of resources for online students, way more than what BU has been able to give us and what IU Online could provide.\n\nSo why am I writing this post?  I'm not even a doctoral student and I'm choosing to do two masters instead of going a step above, after all.\n\nA bunch of you clearly have self doubt and, to be honest, look for validation about whether or not you're going on the right path, choosing the right degree, obsessed with rankings, etc. and afraid to even try before taking a leap.  Trust me, I know, because that's literally me on most days.\n\nBut you also know yourself best, so trust yourself when your mind and heart are aligned and saying the same thing, to just apply to that program or pursue that field EVEN if it seems impractical.\n\nDon't just accept your regrets if you're older.  And, if you're younger, don't think that you need to plan your entire life for the next 20 years, you could literally be using that time studying or working on applications.  Through what I've gone through over the past few years, I've come to realize my own path, even in spite of chronic mental and physical health issues.  \n\nAnd, academically, what I've gone through is beautiful, even if mundane.  HCC taught me self discipline, UH taught me how to learn, BU taught me to be resilient, and ASU will allow me to live my dream.  What you've gone through is also beautiful and your story to tell adcoms.\n\nThere's no perfect way for any of us to live this life.  All we know is that we want to be happy and live without regrets wherever we can help it."

    "body": "**Edit: To the person who copied my list on Xiao Hong Shu, please give me my credit. Thanks!**\n\nFor the past couple of days, I joined my friend u/[tomatoparticles](https://www.reddit.com/user/tomatoparticles/) in her quest and called 20+ more schools about their waitlist, this is what they said (in order of date that I called them). Shoutout to Cornell, Notre Dame, and Northwestern for not picking up!!!\n\nAlso, as always, *take everything with a grain of salt because different people answering the phone may give different responses.* if there's anything confusing/vague, it's because of the way that the admissions offices answered my questions\n\n**Amherst** (Called on 5/19): there have been very few waitlist offers made so far and they're trying to figure out if they can take anyone else off the waitlist, but If they do, the number will be incredibly small. if they decide to take anyone else off, they will notify them by the end of this week at latest. they said they're trying to get their class wrapped up as quickly as possible\n\n**Syracuse** (5/19): ok so the lady who picked up didn't give me too much info. She said that the admissions committee is working on the waitlist and it goes by space by space availability, so they'll make waitlist offers any time, rather than waves and certain dates. certain departments have taken ppl off so far. She doesn't know if they'll make more offers but she said the admissions office is working hard\n\n**Carnegie Mellon** (5/19): Bad news. They're seeing very limited movement on very specific places being admitted off in the next few weeks/month or so. It's technically possible they will admit anyone, but he said it's very very unlikely that they will be admitting anyone else off the WL. Anyone admitted off the WL fills the spot of someone who decides not to go, so it depends on if a lot of people decide to cancel their enrollment. he just said to take it as pretty much a rejection.\n\n**Columbia** (5/19): This is the second time I called and I got barely any information honestly. The lady who picked up just said they notify ppl no earlier than may 15th and no later than june 30th\n\n**Williams** (5/19): (\\***NOTE: I called them before the select summer waitlist email came out**) There has been no waitlist movement so far for Williams. They are currently in a holding pattern and evaluating everything. If they are able to take students off the waitlist, they will begin making offers as soon as they are able to, if they are closing everyone will get an email. They have till the end of month to finalize everything (IDK if she means finish evaluating the size of the class or make waitlist offers)\n\n**WashU** (5/19): Students have been admitted off the WashU waitlist so far. and you will be notified by email if offered. The lady who picked up didn't know personally if they would be making any more offers. But she said the latest you'll know is by June 30th. All financial awards have already been awarded. Basically all financial aid money has already been spent, so I’m assuming most people accepted off will be full-pay\n\n**UCSD** (5/19): So for UCSD, the next deadline they are looking out for is the July 1st deadline bcuz that's when students send their final transcripts, and some students might like fail classes or lie and be held to cancellations, and they will go to the WL for that. He doesn't know the next time they will admit students, but this is a deadline to look out for. And they usually admit students off in waves. \n\n**UPENN** (5/19): So for UPENN, there has been some waitlist movement so far. There will possibly be more movement until early june but he's not sure. They're doing it on a rolling basis. I didn’t get that much information. \n\n**Lehigh** (5/19): The lady who picked up was so sweet, though I didn't get much info.  She thinks there have been students admitted off the WL so far, but isn't sure. They are evaluating the WL as of this time daily, but are not sure if they will be offering WL acceptances at this time, and notify students of all info on a rolling admissions process.\n\n**NYU** (Called on 5/20): The student intern who picked up said that there have been a decent amount of people that have gotten off so far, and they anticipate taking a decent amount of people off each year. He anticipates there being more WL acceptances, even in June (he said they just got a phone call regarding the waitlist from NYU itself and that's why he thinks there will be acceptances in June). They do rolling admissions, and there's no stern specific or school specific answers.\n\n**Stanford** (5/20): They haven’t gone to the waitlist yet– they also haven’t finished analyzing/processing who chose to come and who didn't, meaning they haven’t determined yet if they will need to go to the waitlist. they’ll try to get everything out as soon as possible though!\n\n**Pomona** (5/20): For Pomona, They've taken a very very small group of students off the waitlist so far. They're still monitoring it, and they may take more students off or not–they're still evaluating the WL. He does not know if there will be more acceptances and he said it's basically a waiting game. He's not sure if/when at all they will take more students off. They do rolling admissions. They do consider demonstrated interest when going to the waitlist so they do care about waitlist updates/LOCI and stuff (tho they don't care whether you need aid or not).\n\n**Bates** (5/20): For Bates, there has been waitlist activity so far and contact with waitlist students. And if they're interested in a student being selected off the waitlist, they will get a phone call firstly to see if the student is interested in a WL, and they will have 48 hours to respond. It's very random and they don't have waves. They can keep the WL open as long as August 1st, which is rare, but she says there have been cases where it drags on. They're still making phone calls so she thinks there will be more acceptances, so she said pay close attention to your phone and make sure your voicemail is clear. They basically read all applications all over again so every single app gets a fresh read.\n\n**John Hopkins** (5/20): ok the person who picked up was a student intern so i didn't get much info. She couldn't transfer my call to an AO cuz most of them work from home. She said it's very likely that someone has been admitted off, and that the waitlist is “very much rolling”. And they're aso waiting for people to reply to their admissions. Sometimes people get accepted off even in June\n\n**UT Austin** (5/20): Some admitted have been admitted off the UT Austin waitlist so far. The AO has not seen anyone admitted for ECE, he thinks it’ll be fewer since it’s a popular major. They do anticipate taking more students off the WL. The latest you will notify a student about a WL acceptance is mid July, but they'll have fewer openings for WL in July. You’ll probably see the largest number of spaces open in the current timeframe. As I said before, it’s less and less likely you will hear as you proceed throughout July. They do rolling admissions. They don’t look at financial need when admitting off the WL but they look at the rating of their initial application and waitlist updates that you send them \n\n**Emory** (5/20): They sent out a waitlist update a few weeks ago to waitlisted students. They have accepted abt 95 students from the waitlist so far. They are continuing to notify students in waves and anticipate making more waitlist acceptances in the future. \n\n**Harvard** (5/20): For Harvard, there have been a few students admitted off the waitlist so far, and some have been released/removed off the WL. If you have not received notice that you have been released/removed off the waitlist, you are still on the waitlist. She didn’t have much other info, she said you just have to wait and see and it’s still active. They accept students off in waves and they’ve only done one round of waves so far. \n\n**Tufts** (5/20): Ok for tufts I didn’t get much info. They have admitted students off the waitlist recently, but she didn’t know how much. And it’s on a rolling basis. They don’t know if they will take anyone else off as of rn.\n\n**UMich** (5/20): UMICH has made some waitlist decisions, however they have not made all decisions at this time because they’re monitoring their enrollment. They’re continuing to monitor that, they historically expect to finalize all waitlist decisions by mid June. He said historically the number of students admitted off the WL tends to hover about 0.5% of all students who are on the WL. They usually send a mass wave of decisions on one singular day, but sometimes it takes 2 or 4 days. They don’t need any other waitlist updates or anything, if they need anything the office will reach out\n\n**Princeton** (5/20): They've admitted a very small number off the Princeton waitlist so far. He doesn't know if there will be more waitlist acceptances in the future but it's a possibility that there's a very small number of future students who get off. They do rolling admissions/as a needed basis as space becomes available.\n\n**UCSB** (5/22): The lady who picked up said that there have been some students admitted off. Most students admitted off historically are in the college of engineering. They are still making decisions about how many ppl they can take off the WL. They’re hoping to make decisions by the end of June. She said it's an ever-evolving landscape, so they’re not sure abt the final date they can send decisions. She said it’s too early in the process so far to determine if they will take any more students off/how many students they will take off. \n\n**UCLA (5/22)**: They have already started taking students off the waitlist, and they likely will continue until the end of summer. They evaluate the waitlist weekly. They look at everyone on the waitlist at the same time when making decisions. \n\nIf anyone has any requests, PM me. Please be patient tho bcuz I have like 30 requests for schools right now and I’m just going down the list"

    "score": 173,
    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1hdmixi/harvard_rea_admits_main_takeaways_tips/",
    "body": "Hey guys! I got a lot of DMs asking for tips after I posted my results on r/collegeresults (see my profile), so I thought I’d make a post to address my thoughts on why I got in. I hope you’ll find my insight/advice to be valuable!\n\nI firmly believe that every admit’s path is completely different, and there is nothing you will be able to do with my own personal info other than rigorously compare it with your own application. I believe that sharing specific ECs/stats/awards can be disingenuous, unproductive, and result in unnecessary stress, comparison, and lack of context. Instead, I wanted to create a list of helpful and actionable tips I found to be valuable and true in my experience.\n\nFor some context, I’m 16 years old, and I go to a public high school in the suburban Midwest. It’s a decent (albeit uncompetitive) school—just your average high school. We’ve never sent anyone to Harvard before (or any Ivy League institution, for that matter). I didn’t even consider applying to Harvard until just this year. I come from a middle-class family. I didn’t have legacy factors, nor was I a recruited athlete. I hope these tips help! Don’t hesitate to message me if you have any questions :)\n\nSchool\n\n* GPA and test scores: These serve as benchmarks. Aim as high as you can, but know that hovering around the 1st quartile for the school of your choice (see the Common Data Set) means that your stats will not be the sole reason you’re accepted or rejected. These will also be considered in the context of your background.\n* Rigor matters: Challenge yourself with difficult classes! However, consider the tipping point at which a certain workload results in negative consequences for your health (and, counterproductively, your grades).\n\nExtracurriculars\n\n* Do not—DO NOT—fall into the trap: Avoid the common mistake of gaining leadership positions in five different clubs solely for the sake of your application. A good rule of thumb is that your activities should represent a PERSON (not a resumé). The college should desire to have you join their student body more than you need them as an institution. They want alumni who win prizes, solve problems, and create lasting impacts. Think about unique ways to pursue your interests to demonstrate these qualities early on.\n* High Impact + High Passion + Uniqueness = Success!\n* For me, most of my activities fell into 2-3 “themes”; it’s important to identify strengthen the connection between these in your essays and interview.\n* True passions matter: Top schools CARE when you invest time into your true passions, especially if they are unconventional. It’s okay to quit activities that don’t provide special or unique value to your life experiences. Discover your niche interests, become the BEST in your area of interest (it’ll be MUCH easier since you already love it!), and your experiences will become far more interesting, impressive, and unique than the carbon-copy lists of other applicants.\n* Interdisciplinary activities: These are super interesting and valuable.\n* Ethos is key: Highlight tangible outcomes—how much money did you raise? Where did you publish your research? Which congresspeople did you collaborate with?\n* Group activities: In membership-based activities, ensure each description highlights your UNIQUE contribution to the group.\n* Be specific: Use plenty of numbers and descriptive verbs. Specificity helps admissions officers understand your motives, intentions, and interests.\n\nAwards\n\n* Start applying for these early, if possible!\n* These don’t have to be anything crazy like ISEF, Regeneron, or Coke Scholar. Highlight unique achievements and interests that complement your application.  Of course, the more impactful, the better.\n\nEssays\n\n* The MOST important part: I was skeptical about the value of essays as a STEM-driven student but found them critical in shaping how admissions officers understand you as a person.\n* Important: essays should NOT be used to brag or impress. That’s what your activities and honors are for! Use the essays to showcase your best array of traits as a human and show that you are truly likable, genuine, humble, and vibrant.\n* Revise, revise, revise! Great essays may take several drafts (5-10+ for your personal statement!) to really shine. Make tweaks that improve clarity of your message, readability, and effectiveness.\n* Key words: Think of unique “key” words that represent you. Cater your essays to satisfy these words and create a vivid understanding of your personality and character.\n* Check out College Essay Guy.\n* Common App personal statement:\n   1. Prioritize strong, SPECIFIC, narrative-style writing with MINIMAL “flowery” language. Each sentence should be so specific that no one else could’ve written it.\n   2. A good topic: It can be about literally ANYTHING as long as it shows maturity, resilience, humility, growth, etc.\n   3. Vulnerability: Be honest and open.\n   4. A good story: Every part should serve a purpose and keep the development moving.\n* Supplementals: Experiment with variety in mood, formality, character traits, etc. Think of these essays as puzzle pieces.  Have a good mix of lived experiences, reflection, personality, passion, and vision. Overall, you should be able to step back and say that each supplemental essays says something new about you that makes it even more enticing to support you as an applicant.\n* In general, throw away what you’ve learned at school when it comes to essays. Experiment with different structures and try to find a writing voice and style that suits your narrative needs (I often tried to write like I was the main character in a fun-to-read novel!) Most of all, use very specific/unconventional descriptions that no one else would or could use to describe their experiences or demonstrate their personality, because that is how you can differentiate yourself.\n\nLetters of Recommendation (LORs)\n\n* Build strong, meaningful relationships with teachers early. Talk to them, strike up conversations, and stay unusually engaged.\n* Highly underutilized: It’s OKAY to tell your teachers what qualities or stories to include! Encourage them to provide anecdotes or examples rather than just adjectives.\n* Prepare a concise, informative brag sheet for them.\n\nInterviews\n\n* Interviews are more important than you might think. I had two, including one with my admissions officer! Remember that your interviewer is on your side and that they want to advocate for you.\n* Preparation matters: Practice basic responses and record yourself to ensure clear, articulate speech. Smile!\n* Key qualities to demonstrate (in order):\n   1. Humility\n   2. Intellectual vitality\n   3. Compassion/community engagement\n   4. Charisma/ability to converse"

(i know someone who’s friend allegedly got off the harvard waitlist though)\n\n**georgia tech/gatech (5/7):** they released a wave both earlier this week and last week. the wave for earlier this week were all allegedly offered study abroad programs. she did not have any information on specific majors that were released, but from what she said it looks like the waitlist offers were *not* specifically only for in-state or out-of-state. she also said that not all waitlist decisions have been made yet. \n\n**mit (5/7):** they have not currently made any offers of admission off the waitlist. they expect that they won’t have any of those decisions out until mid-may. they are not sure who/how many they’ll be taking anyone off the waitlist in general right now because they’re still looking at who accepted vs who declined etc, so at this point they aren’t sure if they will need to go to the waitlist this year.\n\n**notre dame (5/7):** they have not made any offers of admission off of the waitlist yet. they anticipate that by next week, they will know if/how many they will need to take off the waitlist. \n\n**uc irvine (5/7):** first round of waitlist admissions have already been sent out, but this was all on a rolling basis. she didn’t have specifics on which majors or whether it was in-state vs out-of-state (i’m assuming a mix of both as with most things). looks like there will be further offers made as she said it was just the first round. \n\n**wake forest (5/7):** they don’t have any information yet on if anyone’s been accepted off the waitlist, so i’m guessing no offers have gone out just yet. they did say the committee was meeting the day i called though. \n\n**carnegie mellon university/cmu (5/7):** don’t hold your breath if you’re not in the fine arts. offers have made to kids in fine arts but not everyone else—they said it was highly unlikely\n\n**rice (5/7):** offers of admission have already gone out. they currently don’t have any more updates, and don’t expect to until closer to june 1. \n\n**stanford (5/7):** they haven’t gone to the waitlist yet– they also haven’t finished analyzing/processing who chose to come and who didn't, meaning they haven’t determined yet if they will need to go to the waitlist. they’ll try to get everything out as soon as possible though! **EDIT: they have since started taking people off :)**\n\n**emory (5/7):** they have not made any waitlist acceptances yet, but apparently an email went out to all waitlisted students on 5/6 that decisions would be released at 6pm eastern time the day i called!\n\n**uc san diego (5/7):** waitlist decisions /can/ (but not necessarily will) come in waves because may 1 just passed. they’re currently analyzing the data and it’ll take some time, and he wasn’t sure if any offers have been made yet (i know someone who got off for artificial intelligence major though). you will only have 5 days to accept your offer if you are admitted. \n\n**university of washington seattle/udub (5/7):** have admitted a handful of students (mostly out-of-state), but officially, decisions won't come out until may 15th. they admit more oos students off the waitlist because more of them decline. they’re also still analyzing where there’s the most space (e.g. if a lot of art majors declined). \n\n**georgetown (5/8):** students have been admitted so far. every waitlisted student will know their decision by may 15th.\n\n**cal poly slo (5/7):** they have already started making offers of admissions off the waitlist, both for in-state and out-of-state students. they will continue making these offers until july 15th– the woman said no guarantees, but that she thinks more waitlist offers will go out. \n\n**university of michigan/umich (5/8):** no students have been admitted off the waitlist so far. the AO said there will likely be students admitted off the waitlist, but they’re still trying to see how big their class size is right now. everyone will know their decision from now till the end of June, even if it’s a rejection. they do a combination of rolling admissions and waves. \n\n**princeton (5/8):** there have been some waitlist movements so far and they have accepted some students. they are currently in progress and hope to have all waitlist activity completed by the end of june. they don’t know about future activities right now. \n\n**wellesley (5/8):** the lady said they will be accepting people off the waitlist until july 1st, and it’s going in waves. she said it’s really important to keep them updated on any new information, but she said she couldn’t say anything else.\n\n**yale (5/8):** no students have been admitted yet. they don’t know how many students will be admitted off WL. but he said that students will know if they are admitted from now to the end of july. \n\n**colby (5/8):** they've taken students off the waitlist already. they’re in the midst of admitting students off the waitlist, but he definitely thinks there will be more students admitted off the waitlist, and it’s on a rolling basis.  mid-june is probably when they’ll start finalizing the waitlist, but it’s possible they may have to go into july\n\n**boston college/bc (5/8):** there has been slight movement so far regarding the waitlist, and some students have been admitted. It currently remains active. they do not know if anyone else will be taken off the waitlist/how many more students they need. they said everything be finalized by early july.\n\n**university of florida/uf (5/8):** the lady isn’t too sure, but she said that to her knowledge, no students have been admitted off the WL yet. they don’t admit by major by making decisions, so that won’t make an impact on WL. they have met a good number of enrollment numbers, but she thinks it’s very possible they will go to the WL. they will let everyone know something by mid-June, even if it's a rejection. \n\n**dartmouth (5/8):** no students have been admitted off the WL so far. she also said its too early to determine if students will be admitted off the WL or how many, but they will be notifying students from now till end of july.\n\n**tulane (5/8):** a small number of students have been admitted so far. they’re still looking through the new class,and within the next few weeks, they anticipate taking some people off but they don’t know the exact amount they will be taking off. the latest you will know is by june 1st. the lady says the waitlist is rolling rather than waves.\n\n**university of north carolina chapel hill/unc (5/8):** the lady had no clue, just said that everyone would be notified one way or another by june 30th :(\n\n**uc berkeley (5/8):** not sure why they gave me a different answer when i called before, but the waitlist process has not started yet, and no one has been taken off yet. the AO said they will definitely go to the waitlist though, but he said there’s a guaranteed response by August 1st, and they take people off in waves. there is no distinction between in-state and out of state students when making waitlist decisions, that’s not something they look at. they also don’t look at which school in berkeley they applied to when making waitlist decisions, so that doesn’t matter.\n\n"

    "body": "I’m dead serious—that’s literally my biggest regret. If you’re a freshman or sophomore, please read this post and avoid going down the same path I did. High school is a time when you’ll face pressure and hard work, but please remember that the most important part is to have fun :)\n\nLet’s begin with my story. Though I ended up not getting into any US universities, my efforts trained my mind and gave me vital life experiences. In addition to keeping a near 100/100 GPA, I spent thousands of hours on math and programming contests as well as various extracurriculars and passion projects. I started many initiatives to help others—math clubs, game modding, a free tutoring organization, an anti-bullying advocacy group, and more. I helped hundreds of people, but I forgot to help myself and became desensitized to overworking over the years. Now it’s graduation, and I can’t help feeling grief for what I missed.\n\nI do have a solid friend group and close friends, but I still missed so many valuable moments with them. Now that we’re heading to different corners of the continent, I regret that I skipped around 40% of organized events. Tears blur my vision as I scroll through old chats and see myself as the lone outlier in group photos. If there’s anything I could do, I would go back and tell myself to join the D&D campaign, go to the mall, or watch a movie with them instead of grinding for USAMO or planning a history club event—but now it’s too late. Time is an arrow, and it never travels backward. You probably won’t have many opportunities with your high school friends after graduation, so cherish your time with them.\n\nThere are also many amazing people I wish I had interacted with more. Only after college applications did I realize that some acquaintances have really admirable qualities—I should have engaged with them more throughout high school, but now it’s too late. We might never see each other again. Sometimes opportunity only comes once—if you miss it, you miss it forever. What’s even worse is that I realized I kind of like a girl I only met this year. If I were to be a year younger, I would have asked her out, but now it’s too late. We’ll probably not see each other again after about a week, and I don’t even know what I would have done for a date.\n\nYou can also spend your time meaningfully by going out into nature. My commitments kept me confined to my city—more specifically home and school—so I seldom traveled in the past six years. After college rejections, I took time to stroll through parks and local sights and discovered that I genuinely love traveling and hiking. Whenever I wake from the dream that I was wait-listed instead of rejected, I would walk into the trees and let the singing birds calm me. If I could be in high school again, I would use my breaks to see the White Cliffs of Dover, the Northern Lights in Yellowknife, the rise and fall of Rome, the borderless grasslands of Africa… But it’s too late. The Canadian university I committed to has mandatory co-op terms, and to be fair, I must look for internships during summer anyway because I’m entering the brutal world of adulthood. But you’re not 18 yet, and you don’t have to rush into that!\n\nOh please. Learn from my story. Oh please. Have enough fun in high school. Oh please! Make sure when you graduate, you don’t end up regretting like me. Go get a childhood! You only live once, and you’re only a child for 18 years! So please, don’t overwork yourself as if you’re already an adult. Go out with your friends; sprint across the grass fields; see the world before it’s too late! You might think I wrote this because I became a bitter loser who was rejected everywhere, but keep in mind that even if you work as hard as I did, there is no guarantee.\n"

    "body": "\\*Writing this at 1:40am, pardon my sluggish prose\\*\n\nThe program I've been accepted into is the IEPA Masters at Stanford GSE. Was awarded a scholarship first (Dec 24), then applied to Stanford in Jan 25, taking care to notify them of the scholarship. Accepted by them on 1 Mar 2025.\n\nGrassroot, am currently working to just get by, taking care of both parents, so am very lucky to be receiving a scholarship covering the entire tuition for the normative period of study at Stanford. Will have to figure out the living expenses part though. So so thankful. Sharing this to help anyone on a similar journey.\n\n**Tips for people thinking about applying:**\n\n\\- a \"what if\" is much more haunting than a rejection. A \"what if\" lurks and grows and bites. A rejection is definitive and doesn't leave you with any hope. wishful thinking hurts. Just apply.\n\n\\- You'll never feel like you deserve it. or that you are good enough. I still think they probably made a mistake somewhere in their admission & the Foundation's award of scholarship. But you have to try even if you don't feel you're good enough. Who knows, they might. \"shrug\"\n\n\\- **Stanford has a document explaining what constitutes a good Statement of Purpose. Applicable to any school (masters / PhD) you're applying to. Read that carefully and make sure your final draft really fulfil all its suggestions. (this was SUPER helpful)**\n\n**Edit:** [https://ed.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/statement-of-purpose\\_revised\\_4.pdf](https://ed.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/statement-of-purpose_revised_4.pdf)\n\n\\^it's this one.\n\n\\- Make sure to contact your references at least a month earlier. You need to give them time. I'm a very last minute person but this is not the place to do that. You need to take into account your professors might be deadline fighters themselves. Also, provide them with a lot of help / pointers about what they can highlight about you. But honestly, you should have special connecting topics/unique memories with each professor if you want these references to really show you in a good light.\n\n\\- You should know exactly how this masters will help you achieve what you want to achieve. That is, regardless of what institution you get this education from (other top uni), you'll be able to put that education into practice and channel it to realising what you care about. Now, in my case it was Cause Litigation specifically for education related issues. Most of my work and volunteer and academic experience tie into Cause Litigation, but not education specifically bc this isn't really a thing in HK.\n\n\\- Don't laundry list your Statement of Purpose. Yes you're great, but how does it all tie into a coherent story about who you are and what you want to do.\n\nHonestly I don't know what exactly got me in, so do take these tips with a grain of salt I guess, except for the Stanford document on writing the Statement of Purpose, that one is really really useful.\n\nI'm gonna share my story in more detail here just in case any one is in a similar place, things might not work out exactly how you imagined, but they might all fall in place in ways you can't even imagine \n\n  \n"

    "body": "Yesterday UMich made two pretty huge announcements. First, they're rolling out an ED option for Fall '26 cycle.\n\nI think ED at Michigan will affect a lot of folks here. Why?\n\nBecause if I know half of you half as well as I should like, and half of you half as well as you deserve, many of you were probably looking at Michigan as a target-reach and planning to apply EA because of the uncommon bump EA applications received in their pool.\n\n(And you were probably looking at their engineering programs or at Ross. We'll get to that in a second.)\n\nBut now with UMich ED, I can only guess the EA bump will go away and the RD round will be tougher. And more of you will probably be making a hard decision about using your ED on Michigan vs. shooting your shot at Cornell or CMU or Rice or Stanford REA.\n\nMich ED is also an interesting shift because relatively few top publics (with the exception of UVA?) have an ED option.\n\n❌ UC Berkeley, UCLA, UTA, UNC, UW, Purdue, UIUC ❌  None of those have ED—partly because, as state schools, they ostensibly focus on in-state students. ED, being an application choice that biases toward a wealthier national audience, undermines that priority.\n\nAdopting ED positions Michigan more like a private university in strategy: they are aiming to increase yield and selectivity at the cost of accessibility.\n\nSecond announcement was a new major program: \"The College of Engineering and the Stephen M. Ross School of Business will join in an integrated business and engineering dual-degree program, which combines a Bachelor of Business Administration with a Bachelor of Science in any engineering major.\"\n\nSo, that's another big strategic move from Michigan. I know a lot of you apply to Ross and even more of you apply to their engineering college. I think this move is speaking directly to A2C hooligans.\n\nI would guess we're going to be seeing a lot more schools adopt this specific kind of joint program, bringing together business and engineering/CS.\n\n**What I think this means for admissions more broadly**\n\nI think this is a bellweather for all undegrad admissions. Specifically, I think we're going to see more schools (even public systems) trying to control yield by rolling out ED **while at the same time** creating mega-strategic joint degree/interdisciplinary programs that cater to STEM and business tracks.\n\nI think this is an interesting conversation to have on this sub specifically because of how directly these moves speak to the user base (y'all).\n\nThoughts?"

Got declined the other day. Not even a waitlist. I waited a month on the edge of my seat to get hit with rejection. Cycle isn't over with yet, but I know the likelyhood of me getting another interview at this point is low. And I wouldn't have a support network in state. I'd been told that I was competitive for both their MD and their MD/MS program yet got rejected from both in one fell swoop. Spent a month getting my hopes up, planning how to use my PTO, move my stuff, etc. Nope. I'm not really sure what to do now. I'm trying to get some community service hours, but the clinic I'm supposed to work at is still under renovation, and they might get their funding pulled. But this school said they didn't have any problem with the lack of community service (I've done other volunteer stuff) and were more interested in medical exposure and continuing education (I did a post-bacc and work in a hospital). I was engaged in the info session, attended the pre-interview social. Had to be something I said in the interview. I did identify as trans nonbinary on the app, so part of me is wondering if maybe that was a factor with the current political climate. I'd like to think it wasn't.\n\n\nI'm on hold for another school, haven't heard anything from the other 8. I made sure my MCAT and GPA were in their ballparks, so they aren't reach schools except a couple, and that's only by 1-2 points. Heck, I was 8 points above the average for the school I just got rejected from. My undergrad GPA was a 3.95, so that isn't an issue. Coworkers are happy to have me for another year though. I want to study heme/onc and work directly with the patients, solve problems and treat people. I desperately want to attend one of the schools with an optional research MS and heme projects. I never see patients in the lab, just their names, and my phlebotomy rotation really showed me how much I miss interacting with them. I really want more for myself, but I can't seem to grasp it. I'm not sure where to go career-wise if this doesn't pan out. I just don't want to stay where I am forever, but I'm not sure where else I'd go or what else I'd do. I don't want to be a PA or nurse. I don't want to work in a research lab though I've considered getting a masters for my own enjoyment. My MCAT's only good for one more cycle (this was my third), and I'm not looking forward to having to bug my letter writers for a fourth letter. Only one school has ever given me post-app advice, and it's the one I just got rejected from. I hate that I was so close to my dream school only to fail just before te finish line. I'm just wondering what I did, what I said, to have admissions change their mind about me.\n\n"

    "body": "Last year, though pretty disheartened about not gaining acceptance, I shared the following post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/premed/s/86W3tutv2p\n\nI chose to share it for the sake of transparency, since there is clearly a selection bias in the posts shared on this subreddit, and they do not reflect the real world. \n\n*Most applicants do not gain acceptance in a given application cycle*\n\nIt’s totally normal if you did not get in this time. There are many factors, including some plain old luck, that go into admissions. If you are passionate about becoming a doctor, seek advice to improve your application and TRY AGAIN. There’s no shame in that - in fact you should be proud of your perseverance. We desperately need more passionate and dedicated doctors. \n\nNow that I got my rant out of the way, I’ll highlight the main things I improved on since last cycle, which helped me gain acceptance this time.\n\n1. Retaking the MCAT (505-508). I was honestly pretty upset with the retake since my FL AVG was ~514, but I’m just a nervous tester on the real deal. That said, I studied around 45 hours per week on top of my 9-5, for around half a year. \n\n2. Publications and abstracts. I published my first ever manuscript (multi-cohort research article) for which I got to serve as 1st author. Kinda got thrown into the deep end, but that was the best way for me to learn quickly. Luckily it landed in a decent impact journal. I’ve got 3 more in preparation, but wasn’t able to include them in updates. However, I did speak about them during interviews. I also was able to publish 3 abstracts for poster presentation, and 5 more I was able to send in an update letter (but these had no impact on my post-interview decisions since they were accepted after decisions)\n\n3. Researching the absolute hell out of every school I applied to, and demonstrating that in secondaries. I would always try to find a way to uniquely tie in my experiences in perspectives with the specific mission and opportunities of the given school. This meant my secondaries literally took forever, but it was worth it. \n\n4. APPLYING ON TIME. So important for some schools. I applied in September/October last cycle, and I shot myself in the foot by doing so. It’s so important to make sure your primary will be ready on time, and to pre-write secondaries. \n\n5. Just be yourself in the interviewers. Make sure you research the school thoroughly, and dress formally, but also RELAX. You were selected to interview for a reason. I got very positive feedback from both of my main T15 faculty interviewers (even though I got rejected LOL). Still, I just opened up with them, talked about my research, and gave honest answers and reasons I was SPECIFICALLY interested in their program.\n\n6. Updated LOR from my PI. Definitely make sure at least one of your LORs is recent and from someone who can vouch for your work. \n\nIf you are preparing to reapply, I know it sucks, but my advice is to just take it one day at a time. It will be this time again next year before you know it, so make the most of it. \n\nGood luck to all :)\n\nAdditional info:\nFirst-gen college student\nLow-SES\nUnderprivileged background\nORM\nPA resident\n"

Perhaps this assumption is correct for MD only and just isn't for MD PhD bc of research fit\n- I realized I suck at feining interest in schools. In a two of the programs I got interviews from, the pre-interview sessions really just turned me off from the schools as they gave some complex info about culture and state specific effects in the new political climate that I didn't really know before the interview. My interviews after that were much worse once I kinda started loosing interest in them. \n- I am super glad I didn't take a GAP year. Ik its typically recommended to take gap years whenever in doubt and I support that for the most part. However, GAP years should definitely not be a blanket advice. There are some applicants like myself who probably wouldn't benefit med school application whatsoever. GAP year could have still helped with making the whole application process from taking MCAT to getting into med school (a 1.5 year mad dash from the begining of Junior year for me) less stressful, but looking back I would have been so much more stressed if I was to apply in the upcoming funding fucked MD PhD cycle. This cycle for MD PhD was probably harder than normal, but next cycle will be even worse, so I'm glad I trusted my gut and applied wo a gap year. This is to say, trust your gut on GAP years. Don't feel pressured into either taking or not taking GAP years. Especially for MD PhD aspirants, I fear cycles will keep getting worse. Apply early if you feel confident enough. "

    "body": "Hi everyone! This summer has been going by quickly, and we’re only two to three months from Ph.D. applications opening back up. When I applied last year, it was around this time that I buckled in and started to take the process seriously. Looking back, I highly recommend starting your writing process in August—the more time you give yourself, the happier you’ll be with your final application!\n\nI was fortunate to have a successful cycle as a first-time applicant to biological/biomedical sciences Ph.D. programs in the US, despite the insanity that plagued the admissions process. I applied to \\~11 programs, received interview invites from 10 (I turned down 2 because I was overwhelmed), got 7 offers, and was waitlisted post-interview from the last one. Just to briefly share my “stats” ***(which I don’t think matter nearly as much as the written statements and LORs)***: I majored in Molecular Biology with minors in Chemistry and Math from a T100 R1 school with a 3.7 GPA. I took 2 gap years for an NIH post-bacc, so I had a little over 2 years of full-time research experience when I applied. No publications, just two posters.\n\nOkay! On to the advice!\n\nBefore you begin writing, there are three questions you need to be able to answer because they will come up in some way, shape, or form at least fifty times this cycle:\n\n* **Why do you want to get a Ph.D. in \\[insert field here\\]?** \n   * You have to be able to convince the admissions committee that you **need** a Ph.D. to achieve your career goal. If they believe, even for a second, that you could maybe accomplish this with a master’s or just more work experience, they’ll give the spot to a person who demonstrates the need for a doctorate\n   * *For example, professors and senior R&D scientists in industry or government (and other scientific leadership positions) are generally understood to “require” a Ph.D., while there’s a little more ambiguity about whether consultants and clinical researchers must have a Ph.D.*\n* **What do you want to study in graduate school?**\n   * **Keep it broad.** The narrower your research interests are, the harder it is to convince a program to let you in (this is a part of fit, which we’ll get into later). If your research interests are super narrow and only one P.I. is working in that area, they probably won’t let you in. Why? Well, what happens if that P.I. isn’t accepting students, or you don’t get along with them? Will you even consider working with someone else? Would you even stay in the program?\n   * **These are all very valid concerns for an admissions committee trying to figure out who should be in their rotation cohort**\n   * If you’re interested in a specific pathway implicated in cancer, instead of saying “I want to study XYZ pathway”, you can say “**I hope to study protein-protein (or protein-nucleic acid) interactions that are implicated in disease.”**\n   * Don’t get bogged down by the technique or the system you want to study! But you can add more details depending on the type of program you are applying to. For instance, if it’s a more translational program, I would mention something about targeting those interactions therapeutically.\n   * **Make it clear WHY you have these interests**, and this is where your past research experience usually comes into play: how have the projects you’ve worked on shaped your interests?\n* **What makes you qualified for graduate school?**\n   * So the obvious answer is that a Ph.D. is a research degree, and since I have research experience, I’m qualified to pursue one. \n   * But what you need is **meaningful research experience**. And a decent amount of it. This means that you had a) **some degree of independence** (it was your hypothesis, your technique, or just a question you asked and answered in a predefined project), b) **you learned something** (not how to pipet, but you learned something about the project, the field, and yourself as a scientist), and c) t**here was some sort of outcome** like a poster/abstract, a paper (it does NOT have to be a paper, I was unpublished when I got into Harvard), or a talk. **Make sure you are proactive during your research journey: if you want to go to a conference or present, talk to your advisor about it!**\n   * See how none of what I just said has anything to do with anything technical? **That’s the sort of mindset you need to get into as you start working on your application** – anyone can run a gel or take fluorescent reads, but not a lot of people can communicate their work and its significance to a broad audience, formulate their questions or hypotheses, and design experiments to test those hypotheses. Those are the things that make you qualified for graduate study!\n\nWe talk about \"fit\" on here a lot, and sometimes it can be unclear what that means, especially when it isn't defined by the poster or commenter. In the context of this post**, fit is the applicant’s potential to succeed in the program and contribute meaningfully to that program through their research, academic, and social goals.** \n\n* **Research interests**: This is arguably the most important aspect of fit and it’s pretty boilerplate: is the research you want to do being done at this program? Note that I emphasized program – some programs will not let you rotate or do your dissertation research with faculty they have not appointed, so make sure you do your due diligence on the people you want to work with. It is best practice to look at faculty within the department/program regardless of their rotation policy with external faculty. This shows that you are invested in that specific program!\n   * The general rule of thumb is that you need to identify at least three faculty members with research interests that align with yours. If you can’t do that, it’s not a good program fit for you: move on. *(Don’t read every single paper of every faculty member of interest! Fun fact: I didn’t read a single one!)*\n   * If you find that dozens of programs don’t have at least three faculty members with your interests, your research interests are too specific for a rotation program: make them broader and re-evaluate or consider applying direct-admit.\n* **Research Resources**: If your research goal is to identify druggable-target systems, you’ll need a program that has a robust structural biology core (think the SLAC at Stanford) or is a part of a consortium that uses specific cores (like Brookhaven National Labs). You may also need a high-throughput screening facility or ready access to one.\n* **Program Structure/Culture**: This is something that a lot of people don’t think about (I certainly didn’t until I started working in a lab with graduate students!), but not all Ph.D. programs are created equal. Some programs require eight consecutive semesters of coursework while others only require two semesters. Some schools have flexible curriculums with minimal core requirements while others have a rigid class schedule with few opportunities to take electives.\n   * This may be a little further down the line, but the format of preliminary qualifying exams (“prelims”, “quals”) is also something that will affect you. Do you want to take it earlier in your graduate career or later? Would you be okay with an off-topic exam or an on-topic exam that directly relates to your dissertation work?\n   * Some programs emphasize a supportive, collaborative training environment with lots of guidance from a variety of offices (DEI, academic tutoring, etc.) whereas other programs don’t really have those mechanisms of support – think carefully of what type of training environment you would thrive in!\n* **Career Resources**: Remember that your goal after getting your Ph.D. is to get your dream job. Let’s say that you want to go on and become tenured faculty: Does the program allow Ph.D. students to or require them to teach? Does the program encourage students to write grants (e.g., NSF GRFP, NIH F31, HHMI Gilliam)? Is there an emphasis on scientific communication?\n   * These are all resources that will help you accomplish your goal of becoming a faculty member at a university someday and you need to make sure that the programs you are interested in have those resources!\n   * If you want to work in industry look for programs with networking and mentorship services for graduate students with industry professionals, translational medicine certificates, student organizations centered around start-up/innovation/entrepreneurship culture.\n   * That’s a lot to think about. Luckily, most of this information can be found on the program website, faculty profiles/lab websites, and graduate student handbooks. I also recommend writing this down in a Word document for when you’re actually applying (it made my life SO much easier when I was personalizing my SOPs). You will eventually need to narrow down your school list by September or October (*depending on how flexible your recommenders are, you can probably get away with some adjustments in November*).\n   * I can’t tell you how many schools you should apply to – that depends on your financial situation, recommenders willingness to fill out several forms, and your tolerance of filling out these applications (trust me, it can get very annoying, very quickly). All I can say is, with the current climate surrounding research, you **may need to consider casting a wider net than what was recommended in the past (15+ programs).**\n\n* **Letters of recommendation** are one of the most important aspects of your application (arguably more important than your grades and only slightly less important than your statement of purpose). The goal of this letter is for experts in your field (in other words, your faculty mentors) to inform other experts in your field (the admissions committee) that you will make meaningful, original contributions to their field once you are finished training.\n\n   * Therefore, it’s **critical** that your recommenders emphasize your ability to work as an independent scientist who is capable of problem solving, thinking creatively, asking your scientific questions, and, most importantly, being trainable. They are in the unique position to speak about your past as a trainee and how you most likely will be a trainee in a Ph.D. program.\n   * Whenever you have a research experience (whether it be as a technician, intern, or post-bacc), make sure you establish a good working relationship with your principal investigator. Ask to meet regularly or semi-regularly, take time to discuss your academic and career goals, and share things that are important to you as a person and scientist. When you leave the experience, keep them updated on what you’re doing and what you plan to do soon.\n   * This makes it easier to ask for that letter of recommendation when the time comes. **When should you ask for a letter? Ideally, six to eight weeks before the letter deadline** (some applications have different, generally later, deadlines for letters of recommendation), but I would err on the side of eight weeks. Personally, **I think the best time to ask if right after Labor Day** since it gives most professors a chance to settle into the new school year before getting bombarded with letter requests.\n\nThe hardest (and most crucial) part of your application is the statement of purpose. The goal of this document is to concisely tell the Ph.D. admissions committee why you are applying for a Ph.D. – What are you interested in studying in grad school, why are you interested in studying this? What do you plan to do after, and how is that program uniquely qualified to help you accomplish your academic, research, and career goals?\n\nYou have roughly 1200 words to touch on each of those things so every word counts.\n\nThe SoP can be broken down into three big chunks:\n\n**Introduction**\n\n* **The introduction to your statement (or anywhere in your statement) is not the time to wax poetic** about how you fell in love with science in elementary school. It’s not the time to share that you want a Ph.D. in neuroscience because you want to find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease which runs in your family.\n* Those and other personal reasons are all great reasons to pursue a Ph.D. in a biological science, but **the admissions committee doesn’t care (at least nine times out of ten) and typically it doesn’t come off as impactful as the writer intends for it to be**. We can share (cautiously) more personal reasons in the personal statement.\n* They are looking for a tangible, measurable, and reasonable reason for pursuing a doctoral degree. Just because you like science doesn’t mean you’ll feel motivated to finish a very difficult degree like a Ph.D. and, likewise, you may learn in grad school that it’s not easy to cure Alzheimer’s – what will keep you engaged with the science? What will keep you in the program?\n* I suggest writing a *brief* introduction (three sentences max) clearly stating your future career and research goals and state that you plan to achieve that goal with a PhD in XYZ field. Now, within the first thirty seconds of reading your statement, the reviewers knows exactly why you are applying for a Ph.D.\n\n**Research Experience**\n\n* **This is going to be the majority of your statement (\\~75%), so make it count.** If you have several research projects, I suggest picking two of the most relevant experiences and fleshing those out in detail. *(Note: If your program asks for a research statement in place of an SOP, it should adopt this format.)*\n* When you begin discussing your research, keep the narrative structure by setting up the experience before you get into the experimental details:\n   * When during your career did this experience occur? Was it in undergrad? Was it during your post-bacc or master's? Was it through an REU or other summer research program? Were you a tech? Did you receive some sort of award or fellowship to pursue this project? Where did it happen, and whose lab did you work in? What does the lab broadly do, and how did your specific research goal fit into the work this lab does? What previous work or data led to this goal? (use the AND, BUT, THEREFORE framework)\n   * By adopting this format, the reader can logically follow your research journey throughout the statement of purpose. If you decided to switch disciplines or systems, it’s easy to slide it into these short introductory sentences before delving into what you found.\n\nWhen you start to discuss your results, you need to make sure that it is not technical! This is where a lot of people begin to lose the admissions committee – **any scientist in any field should be able to understand your project from start to finish**, and a good way to test this is to have scientists outside of your lab read your statement and point out anything they don’t understand.\n\n* The best way to write your results is as a “mini-abstract” where you present what you did, *what you found*, and **what it told you**\n\n* Use the purpose of the experiment and not the experiment itself to demonstrate that you know why you did what you did.\n   * Western blot = measures protein expression\n   * EMSA/ITC/FA/SPR/BLI = tests binding affinity\n   * Cycloheximide chase = tests protein stability\n   * Co-immunoprecipitation = identifies protein-protein interactions\n* Take ownership and say “I” instead of “we”!\n\nBefore moving on to the next experience, make sure you share why your project is important for the field as a whole and to keep the narrative structure, you can also share any outcomes of the project (publications, posters, etc.) and how you grew as a scientist (first experience with benchwork, decided you really liked studying cardiovascular disease, etc.).\n\nWhen you transition into the next experience, make sure you loosely tie together those experiences in a way that makes logical sense. For example if you’re going from undergraduate research to some sort of post-bacc or master’s experience, explain briefly why you decided to pursue that experience instead of directly applying to graduate school and what you hoped to learn.\n\n**At the end of your final research experience, include a closing sentence that emphasizes how the experiences you’ve detailed inform what you want to pursue in graduate school.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* Start off by reminding the reader what you hope to study or accomplish in graduate school with the first sentence (likely just a rephrase of what you said in your introduction).\n* Transition into why this program is a good fit for you (not just research-wise! **mention how the program’s structure or curriculum, or required scientific activities, etc., make that specific program a perfect match**)\n* Tell the program who you can see yourself working with and why. Is it because you worked on something similar beforehand? Are you interested in taking a new approach to the same system? **(Remember to keep it brief and general and mention at least 3 PIs)**\n* Be sure to include other things about the program that you like! If you are interested in scientific outreach, mention that you can’t wait to mentor high school students in your thesis lab through a specific program. If you want to be faculty one day, talk more about your interest in their teaching fellowships.\n* **Have a strong concluding sentence that emphasizes your commitment to that program’s academic community.**\n\nSorry for the lengthy post, but I wanted to be as thorough as possible! I only touched on the LORs and the SOPs, but I'm happy to answer any questions about staying organized/my timeline, my personal statements, CV, or expand on any of the points I made above. I can also talk about my interview process, but maybe when the cycle gets closer to interview season! Like with all advice, this is anecdotal from my experience - I understand that **graduate school admissions is not one-size-fits-all** and something that worked for me, may not have worked for others and vice versa!"

    "body": "Hi, I’m an incoming freshman, and I wanted to share some common mistakes people make when applying to college.\n\n1. First and foremost, make sure you compile a list of universities during your summer before your senior year or during your junior year. This is crucial because you need to be aware of the deadlines for each application.\n\n2. Next, conduct thorough research on the colleges you’re considering. Look into the programs they offer, their financial aid policies, graduation rates, and employment prospects after graduation. This will help you make an informed decision about which college aligns best with your academic and career goals.\n\n3. Don’t hesitate to start asking for recommendations early. Reach out to your teachers and other professionals who can attest to your abilities and potential. Consider who will write the strongest recommendation letter for you and ensure that the university you’re applying to has a specific number of recommendations.\n\n4. It’s important to note that some benefits may vary depending on whether you apply early decision (ED) or Regular action (RA). ED applicants may receive different amounts of financial aid compared to RA applicants, and certain benefits may not be available to ED.\n\n5. Lastly, please apply for scholarships as early as possible and stay on top of deadlines. These are crucial factors in the college admissions process, and early application can significantly increase your chances of receiving financial aid and scholarships.\n\n"

    "body": "Lots of talk here about the general state of the degree/people feeling scammed. I think the incentives are generally irretrievably messed up on all sides, but there's a more fixable longstanding issue in that we lack proper informed reviews of educational value, teaching quality, admin, student life etc. on specific courses:\n\n* Most people find courses through university websites, which have no reason to be objective - most are vague about the actual quality of education and cherry-pick the NSS stats that sound best (see below). They also almost always fail to differentiate between domestic and international employability stats.\n* The National Student Survey is very unhelpful - they don't publish long-form qualitative answers, which means if you have a legit complaint your uni is unaccountable and you can't use your experience to help others. The quantitative answers are also generally useless without context ('X% of students thought the course had the right balance of independent and guided study'???)\n* Universities often hire their most affable students to promote their courses on the Student Room etc by answering questions in a way that gets rid of doubt. It's not always clear that this is paid advertising.\n* The Clearing process makes this worse, ie. stuffs you on a phone line with this lack of info at probably one of your most vulnerable moments.\n\nThis is awful for everyone, but especially for internationals and 1st gens who don't have word of mouth to rely on. As paying students, we deserve far better written resources via. independent governing bodies, to help us work out what is actually worth it. Failing that, we need to be publishing anonymised but detailed reviews of our uni courses, covering both the good and the bad. This is a great place to do so - TSR is all trapped behind a login wall, Whatuni reviews don't get indexed on search engines when you search for the specific courses. See [this guy's review of Motion Design at Ravensbourne for a perfect example](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1bamvsn/ravensbourne_london_the_worst_art_university_in/?share_id=V_7Hu_9c1chcict1vcgSW&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1).\n\nThere are lots of questions alumni can answer that the NSS can't - what subject can X department at Y uni do particularly well, and what should you steer clear of? Is the course truly academically challenging? What are the best modules? What is the admin/support actually like? Is there grade inflation/AI forgiveness going on? If done properly this will hopefully fix the market a bit - unis that actually do a good job will see more students, departments taking advantage of young people will have their numbers drop."

    "body": "I'm currently seeing lots of posts on here about people debating turning down higher ranked schools for lower ranked schools. As someone who did this (>10 years ago now), I wanted to share my perspective now that I'm well on the other side of college and into my career. \n\nWhen I applied to college, I was very fortunate to have excellent results - I got in nearly everywhere I applied, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford (except Duke, where I am pretty confident I was yield protected lol). I also received a full merit scholarship to my state school (UNC-Chapel Hill). \n\nI received the UNC scholarship before I got in to any other schools (I didn't apply early anywhere, only regular decision). I was pretty sure that no matter what happened with my other schools, I was going to take the UNC scholarship (because I did not qualify for much financial aid). But then when I opened acceptance after acceptance, it was both exciting but also devastating knowing I was going to have to turn down these places that I had dreamed about attending for years and years. It was really hard at the time but I accepted the scholarship at UNC and tried to not look back.   \n  \nTo be honest, the first year at UNC was a bit difficult while I adjusted to the huge state school experience and questioned whether I made the right decision. But bit by bit, I feel absolutely in love with UNC. I made wonderful friends, had fantastic relationships with my professors, and really felt like a part of a special community. I was able to excel at UNC, and graduated with opportunities I could never have dreamed of, like multiple full ride scholarships to tip-top graduate schools. I'm now a professor at a T10 university and I credit so many of the opportunities I've had to the fact that I chose UNC and was able to really stand out there. \n\nAll this to say, I've recently spent a lot of time in fairly 'elite' academic circles - whether through my prestigious grad scholarships or working at a T10. And the range of universities that the highly successful people I am fortunate to be surrounded by is really astonishing. So many of the smartest and most successful people I know did not go to the best of the best universities. Yes, those places can open some doors for you and provide you with lots of connections into an elite world, but by excelling at a lower ranked school, you absolutely can get many similar opportunities. I now do grad school admissions as part of my job, and a student from a T100 with an great GPA, strong references, great research and/or work experiences has every bit the same chance as getting in to our program as your typical applicant from a T10 school. \n\nThere was also another advantage of going to UNC in that I was saved a bit from the competitiveness and GPA/EC 'rat race' that you find at many elite universities. I had a 3.9 GPA in a STEM major during undergrad, but I don't remember ever being super stressed about my grades or specific coursework. At UNC, I felt pressure to be involved on campus and seek out leadership positions, but there wasn't much academic competitiveness nor any sort of overwhelming emphasis on your coursework and grades. This was SO good for me as someone who was hyper-competitive and grade-focused in high school. I was recently talking to a friend of mine from UNC who went on to a T3 medical school about how different our undergrad experience was from our grad school friends who went to T10s. We really think our successes in grad school were largely driven by the fact that we weren't overly stressed and burned out when we finished undergrad. \n\nMost importantly, once you get to college, all your achievements 'reset', so to speak. None of my post-college applications for grad school, jobs, etc, had even one ounce of information about anything I did in high school. While this can seem intimidating for someone who really excelled in high school (it was for me at the time), please know that it's not like you become a different person in college and in all likelihood you will be able to continue on your success. Mostly though I'm just trying to tell you that (1) you absolutely do need to keep working hard in college to be successful but (2) do not let anything you did or didn't do in high school hold you back from achieving your goals. \n\nI'll end there even though there's far more I could say about my experiences. But I really want to reassure those of you on this subreddit that where you go to college does not determine the trajectory of the rest of your life, and it is what you do there that matters. Best of luck to you all!"

    "body": "Hi guys! I just wanted to provide an update on my college decisions from earlier this year and say thank you to the people who have helped me so far! The whole college decision process has been really tough  mentally and it's been hard not to compare my situation with others, but I'm really starting to get excited about the fall! If anyone wants to give more advice to my situation, I would love to hear it! Also feel free to DM me about personal questions!\n\nI didn't end up staying on the waitlist at Colby, Johns Hopkins, and Boston College, and I chose to remain on the waitlist for Cornell, UPenn, Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Williams, and Amherst. I made a post earlier this year about being waitlisted at all of these places if you've seen it! My final commitment decision was between Colgate University (\\~100k/year with no financial aid and into their Alumni Memorial Scholars program), Lafayette College (\\~50k/year with their Marquis Scholarship), and UConn (\\~20k/year with their scholarship for Valedictorians and Salutatorians). I ended up committing to Lafayette, and I'm really excited! I *loved* Colgate, but we couldn't afford it and even after we met with the financial aid office, we were unable to get any offers. UConn offered me a great scholarship but I think I would more so enjoy going to a smaller campus for undergrad.\n\nMost of the Ivy League waitlists right now have emailed me saying they were full, so I'm not expecting anything (but if they move I'll be thrilled)! I haven't heard anything from Princeton though, so I'm unsure whether to interpret this as a good or bad sign this late in the game. I did LOCIs/updates for all of them for reference. I have no connections to any of these places.\n\nAlso for reference for those wanting to know, I'm from a wealthy town and go to one of the best public schools in my state. I'm in a class of \\~200 kids and we have \\~5 students this year going to Ivy League colleges. I'm female, white, and applied for financial aid because I have younger twin brothers who are planning to go to college in four years. With rising college tuition rates and my hope to go to graduate school at the same time as my brothers' undergraduate, it would be really strenuous to our family to pay off debt on top of 3 children being enrolled in school. I'm also the Salutatorian for that high school class and want to go into some sort of science (I like every science subject so it was really difficult for me to narrow it down!).\n\nI've always been someone who does a lot of activities, so I would say in the application process, I was more of a well-rounded candidate compared to a specialized one. This is kind of why I'm excited to go to Lafayette: I'll be able to explore the areas I want without being restricted by having to be inside a certain college to take courses. I also think I'll be able to focus on a long-term goal that I've had, which is to start/own my own business on top of pursuing a STEM career! Because my family is able to afford my college, I can start this summer on prototypes and branding instead of working extensively. I have a lot of goals, so I'm really excited that this is the next step for me and it seems like a less stressful atmosphere than going to an Ivy League. I think this is a good thing, as I can choose what I want to do with my time and buckle down on goals. Please DM me if you would like any more info.\n\nSome part of me thinks that all of these waitlists happened for a reason. It's really easy to get bogged down because I didn't get in at my top choices, but I also didn't get rejected *anywhere* this year. It sucks that I might not be going to a T20 like a bunch of my friends are, but maybe this was the decision that makes the most sense for me! I've met a few people going to Lafayette so far this year and I'm really excited because they were really nice, and I've heard what a great job the faculty does at getting students involved. There's also always graduate school for an Ivy League, and I'm hoping there will be more opportunities in four years for scientific research in the US than there are now. :) \n\nIf anyone has any questions or any advice for me on my next steps, I would love to hear it!"

Seems reasonable enough right? \n\nExcept literally the 3rd line in the link? \"positions are open to home students only\" \n\nDoing this won't change the eligibility criteria, it just makes you look like an idiot who couldn't be arsed to read the info - not a good look!

Unless followed by an intelligent question this won't make you stand out, because 100 others have done the same!\n- sending random requests to people loosely in your field is not \"building a strong LinkedIn network\". If you're going to do this try and make it meaningful by asking good specific questions about their work or their degree (if they studied the degree/uni you're considering)\n- following on from this, strangers on the Internet don't owe you the time of day.

You're asking a favour, please at least try and be polite!\n- finally my personal favorite, overly bragging about non-achievements.

One sentence and a photo of the cert is fine, several gushing paragraphs about how it's \"changed your life\" not so much. My favorite instance was someone who shared that \"one of the greatest achievements of their career\" was joining the professional body for their field, where literally the barrier to entry is the money to pay the joining fees! It just highlights that you don't have anything more meaningful to share\n\nIf any of these have actually worked for anyone I really want to know! \n\nThank you for listening to my TED talk 🫡"

I would totally do it, but the problem is I have no way to get there, as it is 25 minutes away.

    "body": "I know this post is probably relevant to < 1% of you, but I remember how desperate I was for something like this while preparing my primary application a few months ago. Given the current political climate, I thought this might be a good time to make this post. As the title says, I’m a pre-med undocumented immigrant. Out of all the stressors I faced, applying to medical school was definitely up there. I quickly realized my counselors couldn’t help much when it came to navigating this process, and I don’t blame them; there aren’t that many undocumented pre-meds. I turned online for resources but found little to no information. Luckily, I started researching way before primary applications were due, and after piecing everything together, I wanted to compile my tips and resources here for anyone who might need them.\n\nAfter some digging, I realized that there’s no single rule across U.S. medical schools regarding undocumented applicants—every school has its own policies (even those in the same system like the UCs) This is where my first tip comes in:\n\n**1. Research Every School You’re Interested In**\n\nLook up EVERY school where you think you have a decent shot. I mean *every* school. We don’t have as many options, so you’ll want to apply everywhere you can. Each school’s website usually has citizenship information under the eligibility criteria tab. Some schools will clearly list their requirements, and you’ll start crossing out many schools based on this info. I highly recommend tracking everything in a spreadsheet. Some resources that can help narrow down options are MSAR and this list here: [https://www.pomona.edu/administration/pre-health/handouts-resources/undocumented-and-dacamented-student-resources/admission-policies-medical-schools-open-undocumented-and-daca-applicants](https://www.pomona.edu/administration/pre-health/handouts-resources/undocumented-and-dacamented-student-resources/admission-policies-medical-schools-open-undocumented-and-daca-applicants)\n\nJust remember, don’t rely solely on these resources because I realized that they’re not fully accurate or comprehensive and I got different information when I actually contacted the schools. Still a good place to start. \n\nA lot of schools might consider undocumented applicants as “international” students, which isn’t ideal—you likely won’t qualify for federal loans, grants, or scholarships and will need third-party funding. That said, this can be a starting point, though you’ll still want to confirm directly with each program because about half will require you to have an international student visa. Here is a good list that has these types of schools. Again not 100% accurate or comprehensive, but a good place to start:\n\n[https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-schools-that-accept-international-students#list-of-medical-schools-that-accept-international-students](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-schools-that-accept-international-students#list-of-medical-schools-that-accept-international-students)\n\n**2. Contact Every School Directly**\n\nThis is honestly the most important (and time-consuming) step. Create an email template where you clearly state your status and provide any relevant information, like how long you’ve been in the U.S., your state, and where you graduated high school and college (some states consider this info for admissions). Also, note whether you have DACA, as it can make a difference and may add around 10 schools to your list, though it depends on factors like the state you live in.\n\nIt can feel uncomfortable to share this info with a random admissions team member, but they’re there to help you, and it’s important they have all the details. I suggest sending emails around April, so by late May, you can start calling any schools that haven’t responded. In my case, I didn’t have DACA, so I was only able to apply to 19 MD with my circumstances. Some admissions teams even told me I was the first undocumented student to reach out, which is why it’s crucial to start this early.\n\n**3. Don’t Get Discouraged**\n\nIf you’re reading this, I know it’s probably a really stressful time and that it feels like all your hard work is not going to get acknowledged, but please keep going. You’re going to be a doctor. Keep grinding. You’re worthy. I never thought I’d have a shot with my status and just 19 schools, but here I am, with an acceptance letter to a top 5 school, and I’m beyond grateful. You deserve this so much, so please don’t give up.\n\n\\*\\*P.S.\\*\\*For some reason, MD schools seem more undocumented-friendly than DO programs. Only three DO schools allowed me to submit my primary application, and they all treated me as an international student. But, again, this might be different based on your individual circumstances."

You did it! \n\nYou successfully completed and submitted your first round of early applications! There is so much for you to be proud of right now, and I want you to take a minute and acknowledge how far you’ve come and just what you’ve done. Submitting your applications is prime celebration time. Congratulate yourself for all the hard work you’ve done even to be able to apply to college – all the classes you’ve taken, homework you’ve done, tests you’ve prepped for, and activities you’ve balanced! Then, acknowledge how you’ve organized your applications, written about your activities, and explored who you are in your essays. That’s all worth a lot of ice cream, salty snacks, pats on the back, and so, so, so many high fives to all of you!!!\n\n**Some REAL IMPORTANT basic advice:**\n\n* Make sure your supplemental essays were submitted. Some colleges don't have the supplemental essays automatically submit when you apply -- you have to go back and submit them.  Check the pdf that was sent to the colleges. If those pesky supplementals didn’t submit, don’t panic. Just do it right now.\n* Most colleges have some grace period for your supplemental materials (including letters of recommendation), so don’t freak out if your transcript and other materials aren’t there yet (Not all colleges, though, so you need to check that on the college’s website).\n* Don’t go back and reread your apps over and over — you’ll find typos and little mistakes. You’re human, and humans make mistakes.\n* **Don’t panic** — they know mistakes happen. They happen every year.\n* But, if you do happen to find something that’s driving you batshit crazy or that really must be fixed, read from the college how to best update your application — usually, it’s on the portal or by email, but you’ll need to read the specific directions from each school.\n* If the college doesn’t say or you haven’t received portal info yet, you can send an “Oops” email and see if that works. Here’s how I suggest writing an “Oops” email.\n   * Send it to the general admissions email address and a copy to your regional admissions counselor if there is one.\n   * Use good judgment about whether to send it or not. For a typo or two or three, I’d leave it. Read above about their knowing you’re a human. Not a perfection machine.\n   * If you totally uploaded the wrong info or copied and pasted the wrong essay altogether, an “Oops” email might be worth a shot to you.\n   * Attach the update in a PDF. Make sure it has the full name you used on your application and the title of the piece you’re sending them to replace (Personal Essay, Activities Section, Additional Info, Supplemental Essay (add the prompt), etc).\n\nNow --- It’s time to let those early baby apps fly! You’ve poured your heart and soul into bringing them about and nurturing them; you have to let them go do their thing and make you proud.\n\nSo what's next? Even after your apps are in, though, you need to be sure you're covering a few things.\n\nThere are a few things you need to be taking care of -- even those of you who’ve submitted all your applications and you think you’re done :) Be sure to:\n\n1. **Open every email from all the colleges where you've applied**, and click on all the links. This is where they will share important info about your application with you.\n2. **Check Your Portals:** Most colleges have some sort of portal set up where you can upload any info you might need to share with them or they can send you messages. It usually takes a day to a few days to up to a week before you get the portal, and not all colleges have this; some just use email, but you should still be on the lookout for portal information from all your colleges and once you receive it, sign in and keep your login info handy! Be sure to check your promotional, social, and spam email folders. The portal emails often get stuck there. Provide any info colleges say they still need.\n3. **Know that it can take up to a week for supplemental materials to be submitted.** Add these columns to your spreadsheets so you can keep up with who needs what. Check your portals regularly, but not obsessively :)  -- to make sure they're not missing anything. That's how colleges will communicate with you.\n4. **Update Naviance/Cialfo/Maiai/Scoir/School Links/Your School Counselor:** Make sure you have checked that you’ve \"applied\" on your high school’s application platform or method they use (and for the early admissions option if you haven’t done that). (*If you've never heard of Naviance, Cialfo, Scoir, etc, it probably just means your school doesn't use that platform for applications, so no worries there.*)\n5. **Follow up with your School Counselor:** Make sure that all is good there and that y'all are on the same page and you've done everything they're expecting of you. Make sure they have a list of all the colleges where you’ve applied early and everything they need from you.\n6. **Check-in with your Recommenders:** Send them a brief email to let them know you’ve applied to your early schools, and how excited you are, and how much you appreciate their helping you on this journey. This can serve as a gentle reminder that they might need to send along your LOR, and you can see if they need anything from you to facilitate sending letters if they haven't yet done so. Be sure to send them a thank-you note at some point this fall. An email is fine, but teachers do love a handwritten note. \n7. **Check for Interview Info:** If your early colleges offer interviews, be sure to be on the lookout for emails, texts, and voicemail messages. Check all your email folders, search for the word interview, look in your junk text messages, set up your voicemail with an appropriate message, and make sure you have space to receive those messages.\n8. **Interview:** Do the interview. Stay tuned for a post soon about virtual and in-person interviews :)\n9. **Send Test Scores:** If you haven’t yet submitted test scores (if you are submitting test scores) and the colleges require official scores, do so now -- even for your regular decision schools. Don’t wait and give yourself that stress.\n10. **Ask Questions:** Consider reaching out to your regional admissions officers at the colleges where you're applying to say hello, introduce yourself, and ask any questions you might have. It’s okay to reach out to them with questions you can’t easily find via Google or on the website. Ask questions of the college's general admissions office, ask questions on [r/ApplyingToCollege](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/), DM me, and ask questions of your high school counselor. Of course, always read the websites, directions, and use Google, but don’t be afraid to reach out and ask -- especially if you’re feeling overwhelmed.\n11. **Engage with the Colleges:** Keep engaging with the colleges. Reach out if you have questions. Go to info sessions and virtual tours if you haven’t already. Check out interesting things to you on their websites. Read the school newspaper.\n12. **Open every email**, respond if you can, and click on those special points of interest they want to share with you!!! This is where they share important info with you.\n13. **Recharge your Batteries:** get outside, read a book, do yoga, have a dance party in your room, take long walks, hang with your family or friends, have a little bit of a Netflix binge, or meditate!!\n14. **BREATHE:** You did it! You’re officially an early app badass and a college applicant!\n\nIt’s getting real…\n\nTake care. Be well. Reach out with questions. I look forward to continuing to hear from those of you who like to reach out to me -- let me know how it's going -- or if you have questions!\n\n😊💙 AdmissionsMom\n\ntl;dr: It’s all important info. You need to read it. 😊\n\n[Share](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/early-app-finish-line-has-passed-whats-next-2024?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4NDQ5Mzc0LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNDk5MzY0NjAsImlhdCI6MTczMDU2NzA0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzMzMTU5MDQ4LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzY1NTYiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.AVZPiLDbjzysAVBpZWzUb653MlGDV-68kU3iWozAdq0)"

    "body": "# AdmissionsMom's 2025 Timeline for (almost) Rising Juniors and Seniors\n\nHello Almost Rising Juniors and Seniors (*and almost rising sophomores hold on to this*)!\n\nThis is basically an abbreviated version of pretty much everything I say throughout the year; hopefully, it's organized in a way you can find useful.\n\nJunior year is where your college admissions journey starts for real. You now have quite a few items to tick off your to-do list.\n\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT:  Don't out if you're already a rising senior -- (or even a fall semester senior for that matter if you’re reading this much later). You still have plenty of time.\n\nPlease note that my views about what to do when and what I emphasize might be different from the advice you hear from other sources and other students, counselors, or consultants. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.\n\nHere’s how I suggest you tackle this list. If you are new to admissions, no matter where you are in high school, start reading here from the beginning. Don’t panic. It’s totally ok if you haven’t done any of the stuff on the list. Most kids haven’t. I’m just providing a timeline for “an ideal world” situation.\n\n# Rising Junior Summer (Summer before Junior Year)\n\nENJOY YOUR SUMMER: This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. Be sure to take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nACTIVITIES: I love what MIT Admissions says: \"Some students feel so much pressure to get into the “right” college that they want to make sure they do everything right—down to their extracurricular activities. Fortunately, the only right answer is to do what’s right for you—not what you think is right for us. Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don’t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy—whether it feels right for you. College is not a costume party; you’re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you’ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you’re ready to try.”\n\nGET INVOLVED WITH STUFF\n\n* Yourself (Exercise healthy habits, engage in personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, get a job, learn something new that’s good for your brains like guitar or Italian, practice mindfulness and meditation).\n* Your family (Help with sibs or grandparents, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, or take care of dinner one night a week).\n* Your community (Community service can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects. Volunteer to play your instrument or play games at a retirement home, coach a kids’ team, make sandwiches at a food bank, or make comfort bags and drop off healthy snacks and water to people who might not have access to housing).\n\nGET A SUMMER JOB: Just an old-fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.\n\nTESTING\n\n* PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT: You take it in October, and it helps you qualify for National Merit if you score high enough.\n* PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT: Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of your junior year. Definitely take one in the early part of the spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start your senior year.\n* Even though many colleges are continuing to be Test Optional, I encourage you to continue to prep for and take the tests because the list of colleges requiring tests is changing.\n\nSTART YOUR RESUME: If you haven’t already, make a list of all the activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. I suggest making a spreadsheet, where you have columns for the name of the activity, your title, your leadership, your impact, lessons learned or impact on you, years that you've been involved, and an estimate of your hours per week. Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old-fashioned summer or part-time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to more traditional research, internships, and in-or-out-of-school clubs and sports.\n\nEXPLORE THE WORLD OF ADMISSIONS: Read some college admissions websites and blogs. Some of my favorites are Georgia Tech, MIT, Tulane, UVA, Johns Hopkins, and Tufts. They are open about the realities and anxieties of college admissions.\n\n# Junior Fall\n\nPretty much all of the summer stuff still applies.\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nTAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN: You can read more about Course Selection [in my post, Making your Course Selections Count](https://admissionsmom.college/course-selection/making-your-course-selections-count-2023/). Colleges say your course rigor counts for more than your GPA and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. I recommend that you take four years of:\n\n* Science (including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)\n* Foreign Language (many highly selective colleges like to see four years of a foreign language during high school. I know you don’t want to. It’s also good for your brain. [Here’s a doc with my explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6EB7rSSrDV6ovPjl3ndD8Vc17cYt4Wlo3YkA5kiLOo/edit?usp=sharing))\n* English\n* Math (ending in Calculus if it’s available and offered (especially if you want to be competitive for highly rejective colleges) -- or higher)\n* Social Science (History, Gov, etc)\n\nCheck out the course requirements or suggestions on the web pages of some colleges that might interest you.\n\nGET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS: Visit them during office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. Speak up in class. Ask for help when you need it. Be polite. Say thank you after class. Acknowledge their hard work and use their wisdom.\n\nKEEP UP YOUR GRADES: I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials. Meet with your teachers after class. Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other YouTube videos if you’re struggling. Don’t wait and get far behind. Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now.\n\nREAD READ READ: Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. Read real books, magazines, newspapers, and more real books. Read books that are required for school and books just for fun. I can suggest lots — ask me! READ FICTION!!!!\n\nKEEP PREPPING AND PRACTICING FOR THE ACT AND SAT: Start your testing in the late fall or early spring of Junior Year if it’s available to you.\n\nSTAY INVOLVED: Keep up with everything I listed for summer (involved with yourself, your family, your community). [I talk at length about extracurricular activities and finding your star-shaped self in this post](https://admissionsmom.college/activities/). Get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or simply do individual activities that add to your school environment. Sit with someone new at lunch once a week. Make an effort to say hello to two new people a week. Find a need and fill it. Or, as [this Georgia Tech blog says,](https://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) find what makes you happy, and do it.\n\nCHECK-IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR: See what they have to advise and how the process works at your school. Every school is slightly different. Let them get to know you, too.\n\n# Junior Spring\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nLETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. Some colleges have certain expectations for recommenders, so be sure to read college admissions websites about what they are looking for. For lots more in-depth info, [here’s a post about getting those Letters of Recommendation. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nCOLLEGE VISITS: Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you might consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Hang out on campus. Then, if you can go on college visits to schools you might find interesting, do so.\n\n* Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also wander around.\n* Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear?\n* Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night. Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospective student and, even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Move on and find a kinder person.\n* Check out the dining hall and the gym.\n* Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one. Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable.\n* If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get a feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.\n\nVIRTUAL VISITS: Most colleges have really upped their game when it comes to virtual tours, online info sessions, and their social media presence, so be sure to check out all the ways they are bringing their college to you on their websites.\n\nCOLLEGE LIST: Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but you can also learn a lot on the internet, social media, and by reading books. Besides virtual and live tours and info sessions, you can learn more about colleges here:\n\n* Reddit: here on r/ApplyingToCollege, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.\n* Colleges’ websites. Sign up to receive info and get on their mailing lists.\n* Common Data Set. Google “college name” and “common data set”\n* Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on Instagram, and Twitter, and TikTok. Clean up your account and use your real name\n* Colleges’ newspapers and news feeds\n* “The Best 300 Something Colleges” by Princeton Review\n* Trans and GenderQueer Friends, [this post is for you.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_oYp5PlIgVSVe9GTRrvcpBLmPy4emBqV/view?usp=drive_link)\n* Books! See below\n\nSOMETHING TO CONSIDER: Your SureFire Sure Bet Welcoming School -- Make sure you have at least one Sure-Fire Sure Bet Welcoming School and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity. A sure-fire safety school is a school:\n\n* where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions\n* AND you would like to go there\n* AND they are a financial safety\n* Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure-fire safety until you have already been admitted.\n\nI like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety out of the way. You must LOVE your safety. Research it and imagine yourself there. Remember the strength of your application is only as strong as your list. An unbalanced list is weak and will usually not be strong enough to hold up your college admissions experience.\n\nCOLLEGE FIT: Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big old list. Having a ton of schools on this initial list is ok. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter some of the schools out. Here’s the [link to my Step By Step Guide to Creating your List](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/whq4tn/seniors_two_posts_in_one_1_if_youre_feeling_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that goes into much more detail about finding colleges that fit you. [Check out this post filled with various college lists for you to explore.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pG1biX7AjKd3YH9LtSvdHg7jMW2zCBwE?usp=sharing)\n\nADMISSIONSMOM'S COLLEGE BOOK CLUB: (I don’t actually have a book club, but I wish I did. These are just a list of books you should read.) Here are a few of the books I recommend: *College Match* by Steve Antonoff, *The Fiske Guide*, *Colleges that Change Lives*, *Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be* by Frank Bruni, and, of course, [Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit, 2023 Updates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OB7agF8xFavMGxZ-nVrQKhAXh6yLh8Bp/view?usp=sharing) by me - (this is a link to the pdf for free, but you can also buy it at your fave booksellers if you want to hold it in your hands or read it on your kindle!).\n\nCOLLEGE RESEARCH SPREADSHEET: Include info like test score averages, requirements, distance from home, school size, programs that might interest you, climate, and anything else you feel might be important.\n\nNO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE OR TIME: Make a No College-Talk Zone or Time in your house. In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it. For other families I know, it might be all day on Sundays. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year. Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your home for the next year. That’s not healthy for any of you.\n\nNET PRICE CALCULATORS: Sit down with your parents and do the net price calculators for a few colleges on your list. Begin those tough financial conversations. Be sure to use the one provided on the college page itself. You can usually find it pretty easily by googling: “College Name Net Price Calculator).\n\nNEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS: Make a new college-only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! I recommend this because then all your info from colleges won’t get mixed up in your other emails. Also, colleges prefer to see a college email address so they can know you’ll still have it after school is out. Only use this email address for colleges you’re applying to (or considering applying to) and your Application Platforms like Common App or UC Apps. I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to this email address if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes, so you don't miss important info! [Be sure you’ve signed up for “more info” or to “request info” on the college’s websites with your new college email address,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing)\n\nCHECK-IN WITH YOUR SCHOOL/COLLEGE COUNSELOR: They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have its own processes you need to follow.\n\nCOLLEGE INFO SESSIONS: If a college comes to your town or close to your town or school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in. Also, be sure to check out all the amazing virtual opportunities.\n\nCOLLEGE FAIRS: Go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.\n\nWRITE: I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what? It’s not! Even the most timid of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early. I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.\n\n* Write Every Day. Even if it’s just a sentence or two.\n* Read and listen to essays on [This I Believe](https://www.thisibelieve.org/). These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects. I like that they aren't college essays.\n* Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on Reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you.\n* Avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays, and often when you read those, you can get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive, boring essays for the reader.\n* Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources.\n\nREAD BOOKS: Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes. Reading good fiction and also self-help books will help you learn to discover your voice. Here’s a list of fantastic books to read. Some are just for fun, and others help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing, and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays. [Here's a great post by](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nwij3j/books_to_read_that_mention_the_college_admissions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [u/SplendidCheese](https://www.reddit.com/u/SplendidCheese/), where they highlight some fun fiction books about college admissions. I've included a few in my list here, too.\n\n* *Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics* by Dan Harris and Jeff Warren\n   * *The Happiness Equation* by Neil Pasricha\n   * *You are a Badass* by Jenn Sincero\n   * *Brave Enough, Wild,* and *Tiny Beautiful Things* \\-- all by Cheryl Strayed\n   * *The Soul of an Octopus* (just finished it and loved it!)\n   * *Me and Earl and the Dying Girl* by Jesse Andrews ( I like his voice and it’s on a lot of banned book lists!.)\n   * *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig\n   * *Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow* by Gabrielle Zevin\n   * *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir\n   * *Lessons in Chemistry* by Bonnie Garmus\n   * Some fun fiction books about College Admissions:\n      * *This is Not a Personal Statemen*t by Tracy Badua\n      * *The Ivies* by Alexa Donne -- A2C gets a shout-out!\n      * *Girls with Bright Futures* by Tracy Dobmeier and Wendy Katzman\n\n* *Admission* by Julie Buxbaum\n\n* *Where the Grass is Green and The Girls are Pretty* by Lauren Weisberger\n\nTAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER: Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key. There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad. So, how do you deal with it? What do you do -- besides post and comment on a2c??? :))\n\n* [You are a BadAss College Applicant:](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/2024-college-admissions-decisions-wind-and-a-little-stress?r=3qhdg3) A post with a metaphor about baby trees and college stress.\n* [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n* Be involved. And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.\n* LEAN IN. Lean into your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress. Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it. Instead, face it and embrace it. If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience is so much about the journey and not the outcome. And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a particular school.\n* Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air. Eat Healthy Food\n\nOTHER… If you qualify, explore these amazing programs and possible options if you’re not already:\n\n* QuestBridge Program: [https://www.questbridge.org/](https://www.questbridge.org/)\n* Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program:[ http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/](https://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/)\n* The Posse Foundation: [https://www.possefoundation.org/](https://www.possefoundation.org/)\n\nJuniors, you are in for the journey of your lives. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible. Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming. Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger. I'm looking forward to watching your transformations! This is a prime opportunity for you to take advantage of digging in and getting to know who you are.\n\n# Rising Senior Summer\n\nThis is an important summer for you, but there is no magical formula of what you need to or have to do to get into any colleges-- even the most highly selective ones. Sure, you can research in a lab, get an internship, or do a program somewhere on campus or around the world. Those are all fantastic ways to spend your summer. You can also do independent projects – and I think you should – even in addition to whatever else you might be doing.\n\nBut, don’t forget the good old-fashioned summer job. You can actually stand out from the applicant crowd these days by making a smoothie, flipping a burger, or scooping ice cream. These kinds of jobs allow you to learn about taking care of others and listening to what the customer wants, learn about organizing your thoughts and activities, learn to work with others, and gain some experiences you might never have the chance to gain again.\n\nHere’s what William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Harvard Admissions, has said about summer: “Bring summer back... Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e., to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead.”\n\nFINISH TESTING: SAT and ACT (if possible)\n\nRECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES: Take time to care for your mental health and your body. Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Breathe. \n\nCOLLEGE-ONLY EMAIL ADDRESS: If you haven’t yet, be sure to make a college-only email address that you use for your applications and communications with colleges. See above in JUNIOR SPRING for a longer explanation.\n\nWRITE: “Write like a motherf\\*cker,” as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself. Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. See my WRITE from Junior Spring.\n\n[Here’s a list of questions to get you going](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LviZQkEwVd6_SY4-XlCMRpVRiCDL_rdC/view?usp=sharing). This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1. Check out [themostdangerouswritingapp.com](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app). Start asking yourself some hard and kinda silly questions. I’ve had students write stunning essays just by answering these questions:\n\n* What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?\n* What do you worry about?\n* What’s your secret sauce?\n* What’s your superpower?\n* When you’re in your room at night, what do you look at?\n* What makes you smile?\n\nTHINK ABOUT AND PRACTICE WRITING THE PERSONAL ESSAY: Remember — no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message — the topic is YOU. Focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are. Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader. You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value. They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application. Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources.\n\nMAKE A COMMON APP/COALITION ACCOUNT & any other accounts you might need: Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background. Those roll over when they update the website in August. DO NOT fill out college-specific info. It could be lost. Write your essays in a google doc. Do not write them in the app!\n\nUPDATE YOUR RESUME: Or create it if you haven’t done so yet. [Here’s a sample I use.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MaObJv_8g3lIGj_80n97Wg36MVib2RaiLX8g3f76rc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nVISIT COLLEGES if you can: See information about College Visits and Virtual Visits in the Junior Spring section.\n\nSTART YOUR COLLEGE LIST: [Here’s a post about creating your college list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/whq4tn/seniors_two_posts_in_one_1_if_youre_feeling_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[.](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/my-2024-guide-to-building-the-best-college-list?r=3qhdg3) Start narrowing down your list — including a wide range of selectivities. Make sure you have at least three SFSB Welcoming Schools. What is a SureFire SureBet Welcoming School you ask? Well, it’s often your most important school. It’s one:\n\n* Where you have direct/auto/guaranteed admissions based on your stats\n* OR you’ve already been admitted via ED, EA, or Rolling\n* AND you can see yourself being happy there\n* AND it works financially for you and your family.\n\nREALITY CHECKS: You hear me say time and time -- time again -- that you cannot expect to be accepted to the most highly rejective colleges in the country -- no matter how brilliant your application and shiny and sparkly your essays and ECs and LORs are. I’m not saying don’t apply -- Do apply. Clearly, some of you will get in and I’m here for that. I’m just saying there are too many amazing yous out there, so you absolutely can not expect it. You’re a brilliant generation -- and now you’re gonna have to figure out a way to share your brilliance in ways beyond a tiny teacup of colleges that a defunct magazine ranks in order to stay relevant.\n\nKEEP IN TOUCH WITH COLLEGES: [Sign up to \"request info\" from every college you’re interested in](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing) — even if you’re already getting info from them because they bought it from a testing company. Use your college-admissions-only email address for this. Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Instagram and Twitter for the colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following Common App, too. Also, it’s ok to occasionally contact your regional college admissions officers or the general admissions office with questions.\n\n# Senior Fall\n\nAll of the above....plus:\n\nFinish up any college visits (or virtual visits) especially for EARLY DECISION POSSIBILITIES.\n\nCOLLEGE LIST: Begin to narrow your college list. [Make sure your list is balanced](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vuing4/its_all_about_finding_your_balanced_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and you have three SureFire SureBet Welcoming Schools (see above) that you love and that will be good financial fits, as well as a collection of matches, reaches, and lotteries (if that’s your thing). \n\nDEMONSTRATED INTEREST: Check the Common Data set to see whether the colleges on your list consider demonstrated interest. If they do, make sure you open and read every email they send you, click on links they send you, and spend some time researching on their websites. Also, go to webinars, campus visits if you can, virtual visits, and reach out to admissions with any questions you have.\n\nCOLLEGE APPLICATION SPREADSHEET: Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics — and look for overlap. Testing info.\n\nFILLING OUT APPLICATIONS: Start with the details if you didn't do it in the summer. Fill out activities, family history, etc.\n\nEARLY ACTION: Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available and that you can by following guidelines. Make a calendar of deadlines and essay requirements and work through them one by one.\n\nFAFSA AND CSS: Make accounts and start gathering and filling out information.\n\nFINANCIAL AID: Reach out to the financial aid offices of schools on your list and establish a relationship with them. Do the net price calculators on the college websites with your parents.\n\nLETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and \"cheat sheet\" if you haven't yet.)[ See linked LOR Post for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nYOUR SCHOOL COUNSELOR: Check in with your school counselor. They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have its own processes that you need to follow.\n\nSAT/ACT TESTS: Finish up any testing you have left to do. Be sure to check colleges’ websites for their last accepted testing dates.\n\nSUBMIT TEST SCORES: Submit your test scores in plenty of time for deadlines to the schools that don't allow self-report. Be sure to check the colleges’ admissions websites to find when they need to be submitted and whether they allow self-reporting or not. And for colleges that are test-optional, do your research to figure out whether you should or should not report. You can use the Common Data Set to see where your scores fit in. Use [www.fairtest.org](https://www.fairtest.org/) to find out whether a college is test-optional or not. [Here’s a link to my copy/paste I share with students when they ask about submitting scores.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnzg3Kc6cP08XxpYi6Slpjh-YhLIeqDHLNZK09z9WBM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAP SCORES: I suggest self-reporting AP scores of 4s and 5s and sometimes 3s. [Here’s my post about APs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ug130e/lets_talk_about_ap_tests_and_scores/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nESSAYS: Start writing your essays for real now. Focus first on your Personal Statement. Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources. Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates. [Here’s my post about Making Peace with the Supplemental Essays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xdbil5/making_your_peace_with_the_supplemental_essays/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). How many [“Why College” Essays](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14mevoYJi-mzDBiDOCqh4Sotiu_Bjz5mOpy7_Hc3zhQ0/edit?usp=sharing) do you have? When's the first one due? Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the Extracurricular Essays. Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1. Use an app organizer for this.\n\nINTERVIEWS: Be sure to check your email (and voicemail and trash and spam folders for interview invitations). Every school has a different method for signing up, so read their websites carefully. For some, you are automatically signed up when you apply. Others require you to sign up yourself or to apply by a certain deadline. In most cases, they are optional, and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity. I do suggest that you do them though if they are available to you — even if they’re optional and you’re nervous. Lean into your fear, admit it to them if you want, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go.

[My Post about Emotional Planning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nLOCI: If you are deferred Early Decision, be sure to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest) if you are still interested in attending that college. [Here’s a post about that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rz2tz4/so_you_were_deferred_what_to_do_now_its_time_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# Senior Spring\n\nThis post got too long, so I’ll talk about senior spring when we get closer!\n\ntl;dr\n\n* Junior year is when the college admissions prep really kicks in -- you got this.\n* Follow this guide while adapting it to suit your own needs\n* Check with your high school counselor.\n* Be involved.

This derailed the rest of the interview as they didn't seem to care about anything I tried to talk about and even seemed to mock me at several points. I had my faculty interview afterwards which, while it went alot better, still was horrible as I couldn't get out of my head and felt like I'd already failed. I ended up getting placed on their alternate list back in November. After having a friend recently interview with the same person and reporting a similar experience, I decided to ask around. Speaking with current medical students, including ones from the school that I had the interview with, they all recommended that I request a new interview and report the student. I however am unsure. I have been been accepted to another program, however it is a much smaller, less known school and as I am wanting to purse orthopedic oncology, two things the top school has alot more access to, I feel like I won't be able to succeed as much in my career. My stats are above the top schools averages, but not by much. Additionally, I doubt I will get another interview this late in the season and will only hurt my chances of moving off the waitlist by complaining. Should I report the interviewer and request a reinterview or should I wait it out and hope for the best? \n\nI can provide any additional information if that helps. Just feeling a bit stuck.

    "body": "Hi everyone! I have been a frequent resident of this community since last year, when I first started applying to graduate school (Biomedical sci, PhD program). \n\nDisclaimer: terrible grammar + writing style but bear with me.\n\nI want to write a post about my past two years of application cycle experience, especially going from 15/15 rejection to acceptances this year. \n\nAbout me: Intl student in the US. Has been working as a RA in academic lab (T10 school) for 3.5 years. liberal arts college graduate. 3.8/4.0 GPA. \n\n2023-2024 cycle: \n\nPublication stats-\n\n*  1 peer-reviewed article (middle author)\n*  1 biorxiv article (second author)\n* 1 poster (first author). \n\napplication cycle results:\n\n* 1 interview\n* 15/15 rejection\n\n  \nThis was a terrible experience. I gained 20lbs. I was depressed and I loathed myself for not getting in. I almost gave up on going to graduate school if it was not for my boss (PI). \n\nThe reason why I failed my first cycle was I tried to do everything by myself. I resisted other people's help because I thought it was a sign of weakness, but I was dumb af for thinking like that. When my boss offered to help, things changed drastically and let me share those perspectives with you.\n\nHe first reviewed my application materials and identified key weaknesses\n\n1. Cast a wider net: \n\n* According to him, as an international student 15 schools were \"too few\" (ikr??? crazy). many programs already cap the number of intl students so to be included in selected few you need to cast a wider net\n* I applied to mostly east and west coast schools and he got UPSET. He emphasized applying to many midwest/southern state programs that are rigorous academic institutions\n\n2. Diversify your productivity profile\n\n* Going to conferences (which I didn't have)\n* Presenting posters at different events (symposium, conference, research retreat)\n\n3. Rec letters: cannot be just \"great\", it needs to be \"this student is going to be the future of science BS\"\n\n* According to him, everyone writes \"great\" letters. It is difficult to distinguish an \"excellent\" candidate from reading letters in a pool of greatness. Thus, he emphasized that all letters needs to be your fan letter. All these letter writers are head over heels for you. He told me to drop letter writers who cannot write a banging letter. And yes, I had to drop one because I felt like that person didn't know me as well as my current boss and the other letter writer. \n\n4. Networking\n\n* He made so many opportunities for me to network with faculties at the institutions that I was interested in applying. \n* One of the great things he did, and I am forever and ever grateful about this kindness, is that 1) he required me to cc him on all the networking emails. 2) If any professors did not reply to me after I send them an email, he will follow up personally. \n* Did the networking helped? YES. Although I NEVER interacted with any faculties who were on the admissions committee, I got some great insights on what qualities certain program focuses on and should highlight in my application. \n\n5. SOP (the best advice I got from a zoom call with one of the profs)\n\n* According to my boss, a damn good SOP is a must. Outside of your LOR, this is where you as an applicant starts to feel different from one another. I really struggled how to make my SOP stand out... and I got some great advice from a prof over networking zoom call \n* 1) SOP is over all very dry but your first paragraph should be interesting. That should not be a surprise to you.. you need to show an exciting element about yourself as an applicant/scientist in a professional way\n* 2) IMPORTANT: DO NOT LIST TECHNIQUES YOU USED or LEARNED. rather focus on 1) the question 2) your approach 3) conclusion of your approach 4) potential future steps. The zoom prof was telling me how he was so sick and tired of reading the same \"I did this, I did that\" when he reviewed medschool apps. It is critical to show \"how\" you think, not \"what\" you did. This.. really changed my perspective on SOP. I rewrote my entire SOP because I definitely was just listing things I did on my SOP not really showing my creative side. \n* Also I am a slow-ass writer so I started writing  all my essays in august. It took me two months to write a personal statement, research statement, and a SOP. Start early if you are like me who get super stressed about writing in general. \n\n  \nWith all of these changes I implemented this cycle, my 2024-2025 cycle wrapped goes:\n\n* 26 schools applied. 13 interviews. 5 offers. 1 offer acceptances (+ 4 offer rescissions LMFAO)\n\n  \nThis cycle was such a shit show and the emotional trauma that I experienced from start to finish is just diabolical... Hey at least I got 13 interviews??? compared to 1 interview last year, it is a steep improvement. Although my offers (unaccepted offers) got rescinded (s/o to U Mass Chan as the first runner up), I accepted my offer to my top choice so it didn't affect me. S/o my boss who told me to accept my offer ASAP, this man knew something was up. \n\nI am super grateful to my boss. He provided me with so many insights that improved my apps dramatically. I am sharing them here because you all deserve to have the same support I got from my boss. Of course, everyone's grad admission process is going to be unique particularly by academic fields, so take this information with a grain of salt. If this helps you I am happy it did. If it doesn't, hopefully it was a fun read. \n\nIf you are rejected from all of your programs and lost about what to do next, here are my suggestions:\n\n1. brainstorm with your mentor the ways to improve your app\n\n2. take a mental break for 3 months (or until summer). Just focus on work and life. Forget about grad admissions.\n\n3. Summer start making a list of programs. Reach out to program directors (by email). Ask about funding situation, class size, your interest and research fit to schools. \n\n4. Summer start writing a rough draft of your general statements - personal, research and SOP\n\n5. Complete all of your writing by mid October and spend a great chunk of time editing and getting evaluated by others. \n\n6. Attend info sessions for potential fee-waiver code\n\n7. sleep proper hours, eat properly, drink responsibly, and stay positive\n\n8. once you submit all of your apps, go AWOL (no electronics) for two weeks minimum!! \n\n9. hoping all of you get interviews and acceptances next year. \n\nThanks for reading this lengthy post!!\n\n"

Despite this observation, the current standards for incoming PhD students are astronomically high. Which begs the question, how come the admission committee is this picky about the incoming students but the quality of the academic studies conducted at their program has not been the greatest in the last couple of years ? \n\nAcademic misconduct is more and more common with authors photoshopping their results, straight up lying or even worse stealing the research from someone else. Out of respect for the current grad students (for whom I have A LOT of respect and want to shake each and every one's hand), I don't think that they are the cause but rather their become victims to a system that it outdated and corrupt. Not to mention the fact that most wages are not enough to sustain reasonable rent and food without making significant changes. Add that baggage on top of unhelpful PIs, long hours and the picture looks very different from what it claims to be. \n\nThe main issue lies in the dissonance between the image the admission office is presenting vs. the reality once you're in. **I'm sorry if this offends anyone, it was not my intention. My main goal with this post is to emphasize the disparity and ridiculousness of the industry.** \n\n  \nI wanted to see if this resonates with anyone or am just going a bit crazy ? "

For them, the net cost of a degree has risen from 12 percent to 22 percent since 2009, depending on their earnings level, compared to about 1 percent for lower-income families, federal data show.\n\nNow a handful of schools — many of them private, nonprofit institutions trying to compete with lower-priced public universities — are beginning to designate financial aid specifically for middle-income families in an attempt to lure them back.\n\n“This is a group, particularly in private colleges, where it just does not make sense to them, in many cases, to send their children to the colleges and universities that might be the best fit,” said David Greene, president of Colby College. “Many of them are feeling, frankly, a little stretched with everything that’s going on.”\n\nColby has announced a program that will take effect next fall to attract prospective students in the middle. It will cap the cost of tuition, room and board at $10,000 a year for families who earn up to $100,000, and $15,000 for those with incomes from $100,000 to $150,000.\n\n[read the whole story](https://hechingerreport.org/some-colleges-aim-financial-aid-at-a-declining-market-students-in-the-middle-class/) (no paywall)"

    "body": "1.) **Keep your options open.** As someone who decided to only apply to schools which had my specific major, I ended up deciding it wasn't for me career-wise and was screwed. Apply to similar programs at other schools and actually research schools. Apply to around 15 schools (maybe 15-20 but that's it). \n\n2.) Actually **research and apply to schools who have your specific needs/priorities** and don't just apply because \"the name of the school sounds good.\" Prestige won't make you happy in the long-run. You won't actually want to go there and it's a waste of time and money to apply, so research the schools, find out what you like and don't like, and curate a list on schools you would actually go to if you got in. \n\n3.) Ask teachers for **letter of rec's** middle of junior year bc a lot of teachers put a cap on how many they'll do. ALSO, pick teachers who you've had a good connection with and a recent class. If you had them sophomore and junior year, great. If you had them freshman year they haven't seen you progress so don't do it. ALSO- I regret asking for a LOR from my junior year teacher bc she didn't know me too well and had over a 100 she was doing, so her's wasn't very specific and didn't highlight me the way I wanted.\n\n2.) **You won't actually know what type of college campus you want until you visit it.** I thought I wanted to go somewhere cold, next to a lake/near nature, on the outskirts or a large city, out-of-state, and big victorian architecture. I ended up going to a place the complete opposite and loved it. \n\n3.) **Don't overload yourself with AP/honors** courses and extracurriculars **senior year**. I decided to take 5 AP classes on top of 25 hours of part-time work and a million different extracurriculars. You just gotta survive senior year, don't add more stress to your life by deciding to take a million classes. It won't help you. \n\n4.) **Focus on yourself and don't get jealous.** People who you don't think tried as hard as you will be going to better schools than you. People who you think tried super hard will also be going to \"better schools.\" People who partied more, studied more, tried harder, might also end up at the same school as you. You might feel jealous that your friend is going to Harvard or Julliard and you're not (from experience), or that your friend who tried way less ended up at the same school as you---but this isn't about them, it's about you. **Don't get caught up in everybody else's life plans** when you need to focus on letting yours grow. \n\n5.) You might regret not doing more these past 4 years. You might regret not partying, partying, ending up in the wrong crowd, not enjoying/taking advantage of these part 4 years, or feeling guilty for focusing too much on social and not enough academics. You're not going to be fully satisfied with how you're ending your high school career. **There's always something you could've done \"better,\"** but at the end of the day it doesn't matter. Reflect on this and take advantage of what life has to offer in college. \n\n6.) **It's okay to not have had everything figured out** in high school, just be glad you're doing this now instead of later. \n\n7.) **You're never going to see 90% of your friends again.** Don't decide to go to college where your friend/gf/bf/family is going, go somewhere that fits you. \n\n8.) **You don't need to go to a T20 school to be successful.** I'm going to a cal state school and it fits me. Go somewhere with resources/opportunities for you, works in your finances, and fits your needs. \n\n9.) **You'll know when you find your college.** It's okay to be intimidated on a college campus, but you should also feel excited. If you feel too much out-of-place and don't think the students there match your energy, that college might not be right for you. I have a friend who chose Cal Poly SLO over Duke because he couldn't see himself at Duke and the people were so different from him. **Just bc the school's name is better, doesn't mean that college is better for you. Besides for UCLA and UCB, I got into every UC. I turned them all down for Cal Poly SLO bc I loved the school.** \n\n10.) **Start college essays during the summer.** I was 80% done with my college apps by August. THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SUBMIT EVERYTHING SUPER EARLY. Please spend time adjusting your application unless it's rolling and needed bc you have time, but it's so easy to get caught up in all of your school work/extra stuff to avoid college apps. Finish a lot of the grunt work during the summer when Common App opens up and continue revising throughout the year. I made the mistake of submitting everything mid-October. Did I feel better? Yes. But did I regret some of my essay choices to certain schools bc of it? Yes. \n\n11.) **Colleges like unique essays. Be specific.** For example, I did a lot of slam poetry and broadcasting/filming. Colleges loved these. I also got into UCSD, UCI, and UCSB talking about working at Trader Joe's and how all of my friends were on instagram bc they were retired vets and 80 year olds in the neighborhood and how we passed each other notes. Specific, unique essays go a long way. \n\n12.) **Really really communicate with your counselor so she turns in all of your forms in on time.** It's easy for them to forget and not do it, and it'll really screw you over so make sure they stay on top of it and get written confirmation from them. If you have a meeting, send a follow up email for written proof and verification that they'll do what they say. "

    "body": "Thought I would share how an application is reviewed from an insider perspective.  This is for PhD admission in CS.  In a sense, the process is similar to a paper review, i.e., we make decision independently and individually, and discuss if there were conflicts (e.g., strong reject vs. strong accept).\n\nIn the schools I've been at, the application deadline is in Dec, and adcom **meets when school starts in mid or end of Jan**. Adcom chair sends out review assignments to adcom members, about 30ish per faculty. We usually have about 2 weeks to review all applications.  We review applications individually and independently. We only discuss when there are disagreements (adcom chair will determine which applications to discuss).\n\nI typically reserve a whole day (or 2 days) to review all applications.  On average, I spend about **10--15 minutes reviewing each application** (less for clear rejections and more for potential acceptances). While this seems short, it is not that difficult to tell if an application is good or bad.  In fact, this is twice what other faculty spend on average, e.g., Philip Guo at UCSD had post on admission and mentioned he spent 3--5 minutes per application.\n\nFor each application, our system compiles a **single PDF file,** which consists of a summary (degrees, GPAs, etc), transcripts, test scores, LoRs, a CV, SOP, and writing samples. I usually read in this order. I start with the summary, checking for low GPAs or test scores below the university minimum. I then skim the transcripts for low grades in relevant courses, noting issues like \\`\\`many low grades in main courses or unknown international school with good GPA''.  These are not as important as LORs or SOP but I read them first because the review system has questions about them (e.g., \\`\\`is GPA good? is IELTS sufficient?'')\n\nI read carefully strong **LoRs** and skim weaker ones, noting either strong letters from well-known professors/researchers and talk about research experiences or weak letters with generic content (e.g., \\`\\`student was in my class''). I skim over CV and look for publications, research experiences, and notable achievements. I take notes of things like \\`\\`published papers in top venues'' or \\`\\`gold medal in an international competition''.\n\nI skim weak **SOPs** but read strong ones carefully. I note whether the SOP is exciting, research-oriented, standing out, e.g., applicant is minority in CS, and tailored to our program (e.g., if they are familiar with the work of some faculty or have talked to them). These notes are entered into the evaluation system.\n\nFinally, I enter my decision, which is usually either a rejection or an offer of admission with full funding (e.g., from TA). I also recommend very strong candidates for specific fellowship that our university offers that provides funding similar to an RA. Note that while the system has other decision options, eg., admit without funding, provisional admission (e.g., if they need to take some courses), I do not use them, simply because we either reject or admit with full funding.\n\nNote that I **do not need to interview** a student to make a decision.  I can tell from the application if they are strong or not.   However, if I want to recruit a student, I will ask them to chat with me . This is quite different than in other discipline where reviews, interviews, and selection are done in multiple rounds (e.g., in Physics).\n\nOf course my recommendation is just one of 3--4 reviewers, and adcom chair will compile all recommendations and make a decision based on them.  If there are disagreements, adcom chair will ask the reviewers to discuss the application. Unfortunately, even if all reviewers recommend a student, they might not be admitted if there are too many students or they are not a good fit for the program (e.g., no one is willing to advise them)."

    "body": "If you’re a procrastinator like me, you might have put off starting your applications until now. Not to worry – it’s not too late! But it's definitely time to get this party started – like right now. I mean like TICK TOCK.\n\n(If you only need help with the last-minute personal essay, skip this first part.)\n\n# Overall Last Minute Application Guide\n\n1. **Look for schools with Jan 5 or later deadlines:** You can sort by that on the Common App. (Of course, this can work for Jan 1 apps, too -- just plan to be working on apps all week.)\n2. **Take care of the elephants and frogs:** I like to eat all my frogs first. Gobble up all those little nagging things that I need to do to get them out of the way. Then, I break everything into big chunks — basically learn to “eat the elephant” — so break it down to digestible bites.\n3. **Start here:** Make a list of all the essays you have to write.\n4. **Organize all your essays:** Organize by Why College, Why Major, Diversity, Community, Leadership, EC, Change the World, Brings You Joy, etc. Make a list of each one with the word count to see how many essays you actually have to write.\n5. **Work first on the two most important schools to you:** Get those submitted and out of the way.\n6. **Apply to any schools that don't have supplemental essays right now!**\n7. **Do research on each college with Why College/Why Major supplements:** Check out classes, clubs, opportunities, vibe, school mission statement, and profs you want to study under. Make a table so it’s easily accessible or list it all under the prompt.\n8. **Reduce Reuse Recycle:** Then do the schools with similar essays, and that require the fewest shortest essays next and get them submitted and out of the way. **Be sure to change all school-specific info**. Remember, these essays are just as much about you as they are about the school. Also, don’t hesitate to Frankenstein your essays as you move forward. Pull one paragraph from one and another from another as essay topics vary slightly. Often my students will label the main subjects of their essays at the top of the supplementals so they can easily find what they need.\n9. **Test Scores:** Be sure to officially submit test scores to any colleges where you’re sending your scores, and they don’t allow you to self-report. (Do that now)\n10. **Make Daily Lists:** Make a list every day with what you need to do that day on one side and what needs to be done long-term on the other. Update it daily.\n11. **Update your Naviance or school app system** with your apps or any additional colleges you've added\n12.

It's not the kind of essay like you'd write for your English teacher in school. It doesn't need an introduction necessarily -- so don't spend a lot of time thinking about a \"hook\" in the way I see most of you think about it.  A personal essay is its own kind of style of writing -- think of it more like a conversation -- with lots and lots of specific details about you, your life, and what you care about.\n\nFollow this guide, and you will end up with a personal essay that demonstrates who you are in no time. These are the exact steps I follow with my clients. It works. Time-tested. Student-tested.\n\n**STEP ONE: STOP READING ANY AND ALL ACCEPTED ESSAYS**\n\n**STEP TWO: I LOVE... ONE MINUTE EXERCISE**\n\nSet a one-minute timer on your phone and list as many things as you can that you love. Then, do what you value. Then do what you believe. Do it with a friend or do it on your own. If you write them down, you’ll be able to look back at them, but it’s ok to just say them out loud, too. It’s a good warm-up. (Idea borrowed from College Essay Guy (and changed up a little))\n\n**STEP THREE: GO WITHIN**\n\nHere’s the deal about the personal essay. It has to be just that — super, incredibly, deeply personal. The essay needs to be about inner you — the you they can’t get to know anywhere else in your application. So, you have to peel off your onion layers, find your inner Shrek, dig in super deep, and get to know yourself like you’ve never done before. It’s not easy. Ask yourself (and write down these answers) some really personal questions like:\n\nWhat do I believe?\n\nWhat do I think?\n\nWhat do I value?\n\nWhat keeps me up at night?\n\nWhat do I get excited about?\n\nWhat comforts me?\n\nWhat worries me?\n\nWhat’s important to me?\n\nWho are my superheroes?\n\nWhat’s my superpower?\n\nWhat would my superpower be if I could have any superpower?\n\nWhat’s my special sauce?\n\nWhat reminds me of home?\n\nJust play with these. And learn a lot. Become the expert on you because you are really the only person who can be the expert on you. Look for themes that tell about you. Then, you’ll be ready to teach the lesson about who you are and what you believe and value to the application readers. The vehicle you use to get your message across really isn’t as important as what you’re saying about yourself. This doesn’t have to be (and, in my opinion) shouldn’t be a complete narrative. I think the essays need to be more reflection and analysis than a story. Those are the essays that stick with me after reading a few thousand of them. Look, I’m not saying don’t use a story. Use one if that’s what feels right for you. But I believe the story is only the vehicle for getting the message of who you are across the page. I like to see more commentary and less narrative, so for me, the Show, not Tell, isn’t really effective. I prefer show and tell — like kindergarten. I don’t want a rundown of your activities — if something is discussed elsewhere in your application, to me, you don’t want to waste the valuable space of the personal essay.\n\n**STEP FOUR: FUN WITH WRITING AND QUESTIONS on TMDWA (the most dangerous writing app)**\n\nThis is fun. Pick three or four of the questions above [and write on the www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com](https://www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com/). I like the superhero one, the what do I believe, or you could even write about your zombie hunting skills, but you pick the ones you like most. Give yourself five minutes only to write as much as you can. The cool thing about the most dangerous writing app is that if you stop, you lose what you write, so be careful. I’ve had many, many students end up using what they wrote in those five minutes as the catalyst or largest part of their essay. Copy and paste those paragraphs to a Google doc so you can use them if you want.\n\n**STEP FIVE: WRITE YOUR ESSAY**\n\nTake what you've written on TMDWA (the most dangerous writing app) and use that to get yourself going. Write your essay. Focus on who you are — not what you do. Your job is to build a connection with your reader. You build a connection by allowing someone in and being vulnerable. So take what you learned about yourself and share that knowledge. The easiest way to move forward with it is to use a This I Believe type format. Some focus on one belief that you thought of and then write about it. You can use the words I believe, I think, I value, I wonder, I know. If they fit in your essay then you know that it’s personal.\n\n**STEP SIX: ADD SPECIFIC DETAILS**\n\nThe specifics about your thoughts and your life is what makes your essay \"unique\" (ugh I hate that word). No one else has the specific way of thinking about the world or the specific experiences you have had, so make sure you include the details!!!! If any sentence has a vague thought or description of an experience, stop and fix it.\n\n**STEP SEVEN: EDIT**\n\nEdit the sh!t out of your essay. Make sure you read it on your computer, read it on paper, and read it out loud, and have at least one other person you trust look it over. Then, read it backward and have your computer read to you. [Here’s a post I made](https://admissionsmom.college/college-essays/editing-college-admissions-essays/here-are-your-2023-quick-and-dirty-tips-for-editing-admissions-essays/) that reviews how to edit essays. (My favorite editing hint: eliminate all adverbs, reallys, very, and most of your thats and sos. My second favorite editing hint: use contractions to save word space, make it more readable, and feel more personal)\n\n**STEP EIGHT: BREATHE**\n\nPat yourself on the back, sit back, and smile.\n\n**MORE RESOURCES:**\n\nIf you’d like to go into more depth, a couple of months ago, I posted about the personal essay [with my step-by-step guide](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/all-about-the-personal-essay-2024) and links to some of my fave resources. Also, check out my [YouTube LiveStream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtRTeTEiK2c) on the Personal Essay, where I walk you through the exact same writing process I do with my students.\n\n**Good luck and have fun with it!**\n\nTl;dr: You do have time, but you’ve got to get to work. Think of your essay as a way to build a bridge between you and the reader, and you build bridges by creating connections, and you create connections by allowing yourself to go within and allowing yourself to be just a little bit vulnerable.\n\nXOXO AdmissionsMom"

She has some decently competitive EA acceptances already in hand at objectively \"better\" institutions, including some other honors programs, and still awaiting decisions from schools that won't release until late March.  However, prestige isn't the only thing she cares about and she wants a full picture - admission decisions and finances - before deciding.  She specifically did not apply any binding ED because of this.\n\nAnyway, she replies and expresses this to the program director, saying if she attends said school, she will join the honors program, thinking that was enough intent to participate.  Director \"compromised\" by giving her til 3/10 to decide before she's rescinded (program, not overall college).  College apps weren't like this when I applied, and this is our first kid going to college so I don't have all the experience in the world, but have done a good amount of research and never heard something like this, and none of the other honors admittances have this separate take it or leave it deadline.  If anything, you'd expect an honors candidate at a smaller school to also be waiting for on that bigger decision day timing, right?\n\nIt feels a bit like athletic recruiting - which has been part of our journey so far - and that I can understand, because of team sizes, scholarships, etc... but there's no add'l tuition money provided here that has to be budgeted.  I suppose cohort size could matter, but still - weird to me that an academic program acts this way.  The other D3 schools with athletic interest aren't even pressuring her this much.  It's almost enough for us to just withdraw the application altogether.\n\nCurious if anyone's seen similar policies or this if this is more common/expected than I'm thinking.  None of it was outlined in the application to the program, which if we withdraw, will be expressed as a suggestion to prevent wasted time for everyone involved in the future."

It's pure perfomative knowledge, and universities know it.   \n  \nIn a zero-sum game, who benefits from a purely performative aspect of admissions? The ones who know it's a performance  \n  \nThe question is a pretty weak one to determine a holistic understanding of an applicant. It necessarily invites superficial responses, which tells little about the applicants' deeper values (what should really be the priority for \"fit\") or sense of initiative—the former of which is much better assesed by many different types of prompts and the latter of which is relatively unimportant for a university-specific question; students don't actually need a game plan of what they're gonna do as soon they touch down on campus, the colleges don't even expect them too.\n\nAre the universities actually just insecure about themselves? Maybe, but I think it's more likely a way to subtley benefit those who are familiar with admissions, and in turn the wealthy. It's not a secret that the entire system already benefits those with the cultural capital to navigate it, but colleges frame themselves as opposed to the inequities of the system. However, the institutional priorities of colleges fundamentally agree with the system: multi-generation college families are statistically more likely to succeed in college, making them a less risky bet.\n\nSo how do colleges balance a face of equity, holistic admission, and an internal necessity for inequity? By exploiting the subjectivity of holistic admissions; by using the \"fit\" factor like an abstract number that automatically balances the books. The \"Why Us?\" question rarely provides deep insights into an applicant and even more rarely provides insights that can't be found more effectively from other questions. What it does provide insights into, though, is an applicants institutional familiarity, wether that be from not knowing colleges display their programs on their websites at all to knowing precisely how to communciate to the admissions officer pre-existing familiarity with higher education culture.\n\nWe don't have to overcomplicate it or villanize AOs though. Most factors of college applications are already positively correlated with socioeconomic status (as in a resume tends to get \"better\" as socioeconomic status rises). This is just another factor where objectively positive results will benefit the university and also happen to perpetuate inequity. It's also a factor that is arguably more insidious about it, as it sits squarely in the protection of holistic discretion while also being one the most quantifiable qualifiable aspects of admission."

    "body": "I find it borderline disgusting and infuriating that no matter how far I look, every university in the UK's art programs whether its for illustration, Fine Art, Concept Art, or anything that involves drawing/painting a picture its incredibly lack luster and won't teach you skills or give decent resources and most successful artists coming from these universities are mostly self taught and can never reference to much of their inspiration from their course.\n\nI did video game art specifically for concept art and I learned absolutely nothing from University and had time dedicated to my specialism immensely cut to learn stuff I did not sign up for to meet a standard within a curriculum and will not guide any student towards the path of learning traditional drawing/painting and fundamentals like perspective and anatomy. Thankfully I was employed as a 2-d artist for a small indie studio but heres the thing, I did the bare minimum in order to get a low grade in University since I focused more on my art and conventionally hirable outcomes which was counter intuitive to getting a good grade which I couldn't care less about since its a portfolio that gets you hired. And how did I learn? I would simply watch youtube tutorials and copied drawings from one drawing education book. (I learned more about drawing fundamentals from 30 pages of a Loomis book than my ENTIRE tenure at University)\n\nPeople pay a lot of money to go to university and take it seriously. How can I do an art course that doesn't even lend an incentive to carry a sketchbook or have a book list of education books that you are required to finish, copy and demonstrate utilizing to show show every semester? Other regular courses in STEM demand you buy certain books to demonstrate your educational process but UK Art universities are devoid of it. If you want an on hands education to learn how to draw properly you have to go to private Ateliers that you cannot get student loans for and there are like 3-4 of them in the UK.\n\nIt isn't just funding that is an issue for the arts in the UK, its the administration and regulatory bodies that hamper arts education. Most tutors are just people who finished their masters and never worked in any professional industry and if they did it was not for very long, and they tend to not be super passionate about art and just come in to collect a pay check at the end of the day.\n\nI don't mind saying that most people go to arts universities here to buy time since there isn't a whole lot to take seriously. Everything is too contemporary and its one of the reasons I hate contemporary art, not because of its existence in and of itself, but because it is IMMENSELY more prioritized over learning rules and building discipline. A comic book artist or professional life drawer can make contemporary art, a contemporary artist cannot make anything other than contemporary art, a practice of which holds no real career prospects.\n\nI love the idea of being a lecturer one day but I don't think that would ever be possible with the established system we have set in the UK."

    "body": "**Hey everyone,**\n\nIf some of you remember me from last year, I’ve been around talking to people on this sub. I’ve been helping a friend with their applications this year, which got me thinking about my own experience and how much I refreshed this sub, the Master Sheet, GradCafe... you know the drill.\n\nMy last application cycle was a tough one. I received silent rejections from nearly every school I applied to. I was ecstatic PI from a biosciences department accepted me but then, due to changing international student quotas, after many discussions about a potential project, he had to withdraw the offer. I don’t blame anyone, but it was a hard hit.\n\nLooking back, I know the cycle went poorly because my applications were far from what they should have been. I rushed everything. I submitted almost everything on the last day, half-heartedly wrote my statements of purpose, and my recommendation letters didn’t work out (a very long story, involving an awkward encounter with a TA in a bathroom, where I was crying).\n\nThe bottom line is: I didn’t know what I was doing. My statements were vague, my research interests all over the place, and I had no clear plan. I was essentially “winging it.”\n\nAs I talk to more applicants, especially international students, I realize a lot of us face the same challenges. A huge part of the issue stems from the lack of guidance many faculties provide, leaving us to navigate the process on our own. That’s why I wanted to share some life lessons I’ve learned from my experience, along with some things I’m applying to my next cycle as I prepare to graduate from a stipend and housing-providing Master's program.\n\nHere are some tips for anyone going through this cycle:\n\n**1. Start Early**  \nI know this is the most cliché advice ever, but I don’t just mean a few months early—I mean at least a year. If possible, start even earlier. Begin by creating a list of the schools and research groups you want to apply to, and take the time to deeply research each. Understand the specific questions they’re trying to answer, and the direction they’re taking. Try to come up with potential solutions or ways to tackle these questions. Ask yourself how you could contribute to their work, and if you can envision yourself working on these issues. What do those questions look like to you? This process will lay the foundation for writing unique, personalized SOPs for each program.\n\nFurthermore, the application process for grad school is a marathon, not a sprint. Starting early gives you ample time to reflect on your research interests, prepare your materials, and refine your application with enough time for feedback. Rushing the process only leads to mistakes, missed opportunities for improvement, and unnecessary stress. Trust me—starting early isn’t just about finishing your applications on time, it’s about giving yourself the space to put together a thoughtful, strong submission.\n\nDon’t forget to give yourself time to understand why you want to apply to grad school in the first place. Many applicants do so because they think it will please someone else or because they feel unready for the “real world.” This head start will help you discover your own reason, and that clarity will be crucial when writing your SOP and making your decisions.\n\n**2. Know Your Research Interests**  \nThis ties directly into what I already mentioned—knowing yourself, your interests, and why you're a good fit for the research groups you’re applying to. Grad school is a long, challenging journey, and you’ll be working with the same people on similar topics for at least three years. This means that if you discover halfway through that you don’t enjoy what you’re working on, it could make the experience feel like a constant struggle.\n\nIf you're unsure about your research interests, take the time to explore them more deeply. Talk to people who are already working in the field and get a sense of what the work truly entails. If possible, secure an internship or a visiting researcher position related to your interests. Not only will this confirm whether the field is a good fit for you, but it will also demonstrate your commitment and experience in what you are interested in.\n\n**3. Your PI is the Most Important Thing**  \nThis is something I was told before I became a grad student, but I didn’t really grasp how deep it goes until I experienced it myself. The size of the lab, how much funding it gets, or even how well-known the school/PI/program is—these things matter to some extent, but they pale in comparison to how crucial it is to have a supportive PI. You need someone who will respect you enough to discuss, and when necessary, kindly argue about what's going on in the lab and how to solve problems.\n\nTry to pick a PI who’s not afraid to roll up their sleeves when needed, someone who does more than just sit in an office writing grants. If you're an international student, chances are you won’t be able to directly interact with a potential PI before making your decision. In that case, reach out to the PhDs and PostDocs working with that PI to get their insights and see if the lab environment and culture align with what you're looking for.\n\nAlso, consider the lab culture: Are the people in the lab collaborative, or is it a more independent, siloed atmosphere? Do they communicate openly about challenges and discoveries, or is it a \"heads down\" environment? This will impact how supported you feel in your research and day-to-day work.\n\nAnd don't forget about mentorship. A PI isn’t just there to guide the research—they should be there to help you grow academically and professionally. Do they offer opportunities to expand your network, attend conferences, or pursue collaborations? These are essential for your growth.\n\nLastly, think about work-life balance. Grad school can be intense, but a good PI will respect your time outside the lab. Make sure their expectations align with how you envision managing your personal and academic life.\n\n**4. References Matter**  \nIt’s not just about having a big-name professor write a letter—it’s about having someone who knows you well and can speak to your qualities beyond just grades. A great reference highlights your curiosity, persistence, and problem-solving skills. The best letters come from mentors who have seen you tackle challenges and take initiative.\n\nStart building relationships early so your references can write thoughtful, personalized letters. Be specific about why you're applying to a program and why you’re a good fit, and give your recommenders at least a month to write the letter. Don’t forget to be on time—respect their schedule to avoid last-minute issues. Being early reduces the chance of them being late with your letter and helps you avoid unnecessary stress.\n\nFinally, approach your references with genuine conversations. Show that you value their guidance, and build those connections to ensure your letters are meaningful and impactful.\n\n**5. SOPs Are Not For Sob Stories**  \nGet to the point. Admissions committees have read thousands of applications about how someone was a curious child (something I was guilty of). Instead, tailor each SOP to the program you're applying to. Focus on your academic goals and why you’re a great fit for that specific group. Don’t downplay your abilities—grad students are expected to be exceptional—but also avoid being pretentious.\n\nRather than just listing achievements, focus on what you want to achieve academically and how you’ll contribute to the field. Don’t be vague. Show that you’re passionate, but also grounded. Admissions committees want to see that you understand the program, that you have a clear direction, and that you’ll be a strong addition to the lab. Your SOP should reflect your genuine interest in solving specific questions, not just your desire to keep learning.\n\nAdd concrete examples wherever you can. Don't just say, \"I'm passionate about molecular biology,\" or \"I want to study cancer.\" Instead, describe why—was there a specific project or article that inspired you? What question in the field keeps you up at night? Real-world examples or experiences can show a deeper understanding of the field. But remember, don’t list every single thing you’ve done. Be selective and deliberate about what fits into the narrative you’re crafting. Each experience should tie back to your goals and how you align with the program.\n\nAlso, consider discussing the future impact of your research. What questions are you excited to answer, and why does it matter? Programs want to see that you’re forward-thinking, that you’re not just solving the problems of today but are considering the implications of your work in the broader scope of the field.\n\n**6. Stay Organized**  \nA little organization can go a long way when handling multiple applications. Whether it's keeping track of deadlines, personalizing SOPs, or sending reminder emails to recommenders, having a system will save you time and mental energy. It will also help you stay focused, ensuring you don’t miss important steps or deadlines.\n\n**7. Reach Out - Be Persuasive**  \nThis is what makes or breaks an application. If you truly want to work with someone, reach out a while before the applications begin. Learn what they are looking for and discuss how you fit into that. They may not reply to your first—or second—email. If you really want them, push. Do not make your emails too long. Respect their time. Keep it brief, and you can attach a motivation letter explaining why you want to work with them instead.\n\n**8. Take Care of Yourself**  \nThe grad school application process can be overwhelming, stressful, and emotionally draining. But it's important to remember that your well-being should always come first. Taking care of yourself physically and mentally will help you stay focused, clear-headed, and able to put your best foot forward throughout the process.\n\n  \nSo, these are some of things I came to realize way too late. If you have any more ideas or questions, I will try to help as much as I can. Take care <3 "

    "body": "Last year around this time, I received my last post-II decision, an R from my in-state school. I was distraught and frankly, felt like I was a failure for having to reapply the following cycle (side note: you are NOT a failure for reapplying). I was in an inconsolable place, but found some solace after reading u/pumpkpie_chem's love letter reddit post. My hope is to also encourage other fellow reapplicants out there that the journey doesn't end, and it will be okay in the end. (I'm writing this on a whim, so hopefully it's not too disorganized.)\n\nLast cycle, I was on my third gap year and felt that I had done everything in my power to prepare for a strong application. Some more info: ORM, 510-515 MCAT, 3.7 GPA, 4th Q Casper (low preview like 3?), some service-heavy activities, 3000 hrs of research, and longitudinal experiences (you can message me for more details). I applied to almost 50 MD schools (latest complete mid Aug), and threw a few DO in as well, albeit I applied 'late' for DO (complete mid/late Oct). I had done some prior research on making a balanced school list using MSAR, had collected various LORs from my mentors/professors who I felt close with, and delved deep into crafting a PS that I felt was representative of me. Looking back, I did try to have a quick turnaround for secondaries, but ended up submitting many 3-4 weeks afterwards and even later than that due to a family vacation that was veryyy ill-timed. In the end, I received 2 II's: one from my in-state flagship in early September, and another top 20 CA school in December. I was ecstatic for them, but the latter ended in a WL with low hopes of getting off (iykyk which school), and the former a formal R, after being ghosted for 8 months... Each passing day in May felt like torment to me—refreshing SDN every hour, contemplating what further I could do to possibly get off the WL, and basically spiraling. For those who are on WLs, I'm sure you can relate. The unknown felt terrifying.\n\nIn the end, I realized I had to cut my losses for that WL (I'm all or nothing, and it was wiser to redirect my emotional energy fretting into crafting a better reapplication). I decided to go all in to reapply one last time, since AMCAS was open to submit soon. I would say I like to plan for worst-case scenarios... So earlier that February, I had already decided to transition out of my MA role into clinical research, just in case I needed to reapply (you don't have to change roles, but medical schools do generally like to see applicant growth and I felt this was the right choice for me). I did some serious reflection in therapy to address WHY I felt this upset over reapplying, sought advice online, as well as considered whether my application had any unknown red flags that I hadn't considered. I realized that I felt deep shame for having to reapply, because I felt I was \"behind\" some unspoken timeline and failed myself/others. I'd already pushed back my gap years from 1 > 2 due to COVID and health issues, 2 > 3 due to MCAT struggles, and now it would've been 4 gap years (2 planned, and 2 unplanned). I felt even worse when I considered that my classmates from my alma mater (tier 1 school) all seemed to have successful cycles, and many were already even graduating soon! I wanted to crawl into my own shell when I realized I ALSO had to ask my professors to update my LOR, and that I'd have to explain that I'm reapplying. Tbh, that realization felt the worse for me, because I felt that I'd let my mentors down as well.\n\nEventually, I got over the self-pity and decided that I could only move forward; perhaps this would be a redirection for me. I attended some applicant feedback sessions (from my state school), which was helpful in confirming that I didn't have any red flags, but that I probably just didn't \"stand out\" enough. I was VERY torn whether I needed to make major changes to my reapplication since I'd heard that as standard advice, but I'm also very glad I trusted my gut. I made minimal changes to my reapplication, because I believed that it was a matter of FRAMING and presenting myself, and not about the content of my activities or stats. At the core, my \"why medicine\" hadn't changed and I felt it disingenuous to myself to *completely* revamp my application.\n\nSo this cycle, I only changed my healthcare job and my essays (I also applied to 5-10 more schools than last cycle). I worked extremely hard to re-package myself in a way that I felt showed growth, as well as sincere passion and commitment for EACH medical school. These two efforts made a HUGE difference imo. Off the bat, I received 5 MD II's (a couple low tier, one mid-tier, and the others T30) and 4 DO's, with A's to both (though 4/5 of my MD ones ended in WLs, which I withdrew from). I am very grateful that the A I received is actually really close to home for me. When I was younger (not that I'm old), I really wanted to spread my wings far and live further away from family (I did this is undergrad and it wasn't what I imagined lol). But as I've grown, I realized that it's ideal for me personally to be near a support system. Here are some takeaways I've learned as a reapplicant (please take it with a grain of salt, as it's n=1 sample size):\n\n1. MISSION FIT MATTERS. I realized too late that schools genuinely really care to select for the applicant they feel is the \"right fit\" for them. They're usually split between \"research heavy\" and \"service heavy\" schools. My first cycle (2023-24), I had thought I could have my cake and eat it too (I had what I believed to be a lot of research and service), so I didn't intentionally try to cater to either. I tried to market myself as well rounded, and in the end appeared lackluster (well-rounded is good, but be careful with overly appealing to every school). This cycle, I reflected more deeply what my strengths were, and focused on schools that were service-oriented as they aligned more with my values and person. I made it extremely clear in my writing my goals/vision to continue service-related work as a med student and future physician.\n2. ESSAYS are so under-rated. People like to say that you can't have a truly bad or good essay, and the majority are just okay. While that may be true, please don't discredit them. Do NOT plug and chug a template into chatGPT or deepseek and copy-paste into each secondary. I know applying to a broad school list makes it daunting to write everything uniquely, but it will help if you seriously take the TIME to do research about each school, present genuine reasons for WHY you truly like x school, and write from your heart. I was guilty of trying to speedrun essays in my first cycle, and I think that truly hurt my application.\n   1. Schools can tell when you do not care for their mission or unique offerings, and it's more obvious than you'd expect to be able to tell from an applicant's writing tone if they've done their due diligence or not. Some things I did differently included signing up for info sessions and attending them (schools often go into way more detail about their curriculum and mission etc during these), interacting/asking Q's with current students, attending any events from their social media posts, etc. These can help you be more genuine/specific about what specifically you're excited about for x school. Let's be real, many schools have an integrated or flipped classroom curriculum, with distinction tracks, and study abroad programs... As an applicant, you can definitely dig even deeper to find something that resonates with you for why you're PERSONALLY excited to attend x school.\n   2. Additionally, I used flowery language my first cycle. Please don't do that unless you think you can do it well; I imagine adcoms after reading their 10,000th essay would be exhausted from the same overly-sycophantic style of writing. I decided to write sincerely and more straightforward this cycle. I tried to be more clear with my writing and I think it helped greatly (idk if this applies to others, but I do know I struggle with being roundabout).\n3. Craft a good school list (make sure to have more target schools than reaches). There are many resources out there to help with that. An applicant pitfall is applying to too many schools that have low-yield (ex. Georgetown, Drexel), in-state heavy preference (ex. many state schools heavily prefer in state people, most notorious is UW since they usually require WWAMI), service heavy schools without the hours to back it up (ex. Rush, Loyola), or just having too many top tier schools (ex. HYP). I found MSAR to be helpful in seeing the ratio of OOS:IS, applicant and matriculant GPA and MCAT ranges. Be careful applying to too many that your stats are in the lowest or out-of-range percentile (ofc you can apply, but be wary that there's a reason schools have a range and most successful matriculants generally do fall within that range). Additionally, there are a few Jesuit schools (Georgetown, Loyola, SLU, Creighton), so be aware that they often focus on person-centered care/cura personalis. \n   1. I've noticed that many schools tout they're open to OOS, but be wary that more often than not, many schools do genuinely care more for applicants who have local ties or are connected somehow to them. For ex, I believe partly why I received a good midwest MD II was I had some minimal ties to the area. At the end of the day, med schools like to retain their med graduates in the area, so there's reason for them to filter applicants partially based on their likelihood to stay and serve the locale.\n4. PS: I didn't change much for my personal statement this time around, because I believed that my core reason for pursuing medicine hadn't changed. I had already gone through 4-5 iterations of edits last cycle, so I only made minimal edits this reapplication cycle (like 1-2 sentences changed). This may not be true for everyone, so I encourage reapplicants to dig deeper for possible ways to improve! I just wanted to give an example to others that every situation is different.\n5. LORs can be slightly dated. I actually attempted to reach out to all my advisors and was ghosted by my undergrad PI (of 3.5 years) as well as my attending... It was very awkward and I was extremely worried that having a 1-2 year old LOR would hurt my chances. I submitted anyway (with some updated LORs and a couple old ones), and it seems to have went okay! I think realistically, every applicant will have some strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay not to be neurotic over making everything \"perfect.\"\n6. Be wary of \"new\" vs. old reapplied schools! I know people before me have had great luck with reapplying to the SAME schools they did their first cycle as schools often welcome reapplicants. However, I was worried so this time around, I was careful to split about 50/50 with my school list (half old schools, half new schools) in case I would somehow be \"penalized\" for reapplying. Actually, I'm really glad I did this because that old adage has not been the case for me sadly... Most of my II's were actually from \"new\" ones that I hadn't applied to previously. Only one low tier MD interviewed me this cycle that I'd applied to last year. The school I'm attending was a new one I added last minute lol. Additionally, I believe that some schools interview applicants on the cusp sometimes with minimal/no intention of giving them an A, barring extreme circumstances. This is only my opinion, but I interviewed at a few top 20 schools with lower stats as an ORM, and was placed on all WLs. I think schools may give you a chance based on your life story or mission fit, but do be careful overextending hope on getting off certain WLs (like be cautiously hopeful). \n\n7. Make sure your story is cohesive. It should make sense to adcoms how one activity/life event has led you to another, and ultimately to medicine. Your AMCAS activities, PS, and secondaries should clarify WHY medicine, but also prove to adcoms that you are certain this path is for you. They want to know you've done your due diligence to ascertain what this path entails (as it's long, often gruelsome work, and is a heavy investment), as well as ensure you are ready for the rigors of school and standardized testing. Your job as an applicant is to somehow prove/show them that you know what you're getting yourself into.\n8. IIs. Usually they're MMI or traditional. Interestingly, in my last cycle, my two IIs were MMI-based. And during my post-interview feedback, the director of admissions noted that ONE of my stations didn't quite like my answer for MMI :( I was surprised since the common saying is that interviewers just want to hear your reasoning and there's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer. After interviewing 10+ schools cumulatively, I will say that I've noticed that while that can be true, interviewers are still human and they may resonate more or less with certain answers you have.. I previously read the MMI book by Desai and it was helpful for me, however I can't say much about it since this cycle, my As were all from traditional interviews lol... It's possible that I just really suck at MMI or it's a fluke, but regardless, I highly encourage (re)applicants to be cautious about how you portray your answers and I think practice for MMI can help. I think as a non-trad, my strength was traditional interviews since I'd already worked various jobs prior and am very familiar with how to do well in it. For traditional interviews, be human; it's okay to make jokes or even be awkward! Adcoms know it's stressful so there's no need to overly rehearse your answers (be sure to know why med, why doctor, tell me about yourself, why this school).\n\nI'm sure there's more stuff but these are all I can think of now. If this can help one person, I will feel it was more than worth! Again, these are my own thoughts so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nI sometimes get bummed that it took me more years than my peers (which is more of a me issue that I want to address in therapy lol), however I do truly believe that things fall into place for a reason. If I had gotten in last cycle, I would've been ill-prepared because I was recovering from an intensive surgery and couldn't physically move/be a student. I've recovered since then and feel I've come a long way in this last year (I'm grateful for the added year I had to spend with family and friends as well, and explore my early to mid 20s). Have faith in yourself, and know that it's not over until it's truly over. As one mentor once said to me, \"it's a long becoming process.\" \n\nMy DM's are open and I'll try my best to answer any questions :) Good luck future applicants and reapplicants! I believe you can do this <3 "

    "body": "The best advice I can share for interviews is that every answer you give should have three parts (technically every answer doesn't have to have the third, but it's a good goal):\n\n**1. The Answer.** This is the actual response to the question. So if they ask for your favorite subject, you say \n\n>\"Chemistry.\" \n\nThis is sort of bare minimum, but you already know how to do this.\n\n**2. The Evidence.** This is something that supports your answer, makes it credible, reveals more about you, and cements it into the reviewer's memory. \n\n>\"Chemistry, because I really admired my grandfather and he was a chemist.\" \n\nNow you have a good response because it shows family is important to you and that you have a reason behind your answer.\n\n**3. The Interpretation.** What does your answer mean? Why is it important to you? What core values, character attributes, strengths, or personal qualities does it demonstrate? \n\n>\"Chemistry, because I really admired my grandfather and he was a chemist. Sometimes he would show me stuff and it always seemed like magic to me. I still feel that magic in the lab.\" \n\nNow you have a great answer. It feels personal and expressive of who you are. It shows how you think and is fully believable. It sticks with the interviewer and makes you stand out.  There's passion, character, honesty, and likability in there.  This will wow the interviewer and leave a strong impression.  \n\nThis doesn't mean you have to give an epic treatise or divide your answer into chapters. You can still keep it simple and to-the-point.  Also, be wary of over-preparing or memorizing responses.  You can have some ideas in mind or bullet points you'd like to share, but you don't want to come across as rehearsed or insincere.\n\nIf you're looking for more, check out [this guide I wrote on interviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9ujnzd/there_have_been_many_questions_about_interviews/) or the other posts in the A2C wiki. \n\nAlso, here are my thoughts on some common interview questions:\n\n#Common Interview Questions\n\n**1.\tTell me about yourself.**\n\nThis is the most common lead off question. Don't give basic info about where you're from, what you do in school, or anything too directly related to your application. Talk instead about your personality, what you *like* to do, or something actually interesting about yourself. Think about this question as if a room of 30 students is being asked and you have to say something that will make you stand out. One student I know led off with \"I'm a professional and volunteer magician. Want to see a trick?\" Your answer should make the interviewer interested in going deeper, so don't respond like it's a boring documentary. Feel free to be personal and genuine. Don't just start reading your resume to them or telling your whole life's story.  One mistake students often make with this question is biting off WAY too much with their answer. This isn't the only question you will be asked. So don't feel like you have to cover everything about yourself with your response. They're just asking for a sample, a taste-test of your personality, or a starting point. Don't kill an insect with a flamethrower here. Just get the ball rolling and let the interviewer ask more questions or dig deeper into anything they deem worthwhile.\n\n**2. Why do you want to attend college here?**\n\nLead off with a few things you like about the school or what initially caught your eye.  But don't just talk about how great the school is.  You want to communicate that you think it's great, but you also want to show why *you* are a good fit for the school.  Your answer should include some things that couldn't be said by just anyone.  Also, your primary answer should be more than the school's rankings, prestige, selectiveness, or employment prospects after graduation.  Focusing on those seems cold and mercenary and doesn't really show depth or passion.  You can review my [guide to the \"Why [School]?\" essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bgvslr/the_scholargrade_essay_series_part_3_conquering/) for more on this because the same themes apply to this question.  If you only remember one thing about answering this question, it should be this:  Don't just say, \"Your school has this thing, and I think it's neat.\"  Instead, share what you value about it, and why that's meaningful or important to you.  That difference may seem subtle, but the latter approach has way more depth, dimension, and personal insight, and the interviewer gets to learn a lot more about you through it.\n\n**3. Why do you want to study [X]?**\n\nMake sure it doesn't sound like a random choice.  Ideally you want to have both a reason for it and something from your resume that shows sincere interest.  It should be evident that you've given some thought or exploration to this.  Don't just say it's your best academic subject or it's what your parents want for you.  Demonstrate your own passion for it.\n\n**4. What first drew you to this college?**\n\nJust be honest and tell the story.  There's not a lot to this question and it's often used as build up to other questions or to get the conversation flowing.  If the thing that first brought the school to your attention is shallow (e.g. a high ranking or high average salary of graduates), be sure to go beyond that.  Talk about how even though that's what first caught your eye, you were encouraged and affirmed by the additional research you've done.  Share why it's your dream school or one of your top choices.  The best responses to this question are personal and brief, but get things moving toward greater depth, expressiveness, and connection.  The ultimate goal of this line of conversation is to leave the interviewer with the impression that you are a good fit for this college.\n\n**5. What are you interested in?**\n\nTalk about your interests, but don’t just regurgitate the EC section of your application because the interviewer might have that in front of them.  You also don't want to come across as if you're bragging or reciting your resume to them.  Go beyond this with general interests outside of those listed.  It's ok to mention unimpressive things like Minecraft or TikTok, or fantasy football (or whatever it is you /r/FellowKids are into these days), but don't dwell on those.  It's can also be a good idea to go deeper by talking about why you have the interests you have or how you see your interests playing out later in life.  You can talk about ideas, movements, or beliefs that you're interested in if you want to, but don't be dogmatic, argumentative, or pushy.  \n\n**6. Questions about specific details of your ECs, Recs, awards, essays, or other application materials.**  \n\nBe prepared to talk about anything in your application, especially if you have something distinctive or unique.  This is one of the questions that will make you glad you have your application in front of you and that you reviewed it before the interview.  Some students have even been asked about a single word choice from one of their essays.  Note that many colleges intentionally *do not* give interviewers any information from your application because they want the interview to be focused on YOU, not on the stuff they already know from your application.  But be ready either way.  As a general guideline, most alumni interviewers don't get your essays or other application materials. Most scholarship or admissions office interviewers (e.g. AOs or faculty) will get both.\n\n**7. We get a lot of high quality applications.  What makes you different/more outstanding than other applicants?**\n\nStart by talking about what makes you distinctive.  This could be an interest you have and how you pursued it, or a unique combination of interests you have, or an outstanding accomplishment.  If you don’t feel like you have anything really punchy and bold, you can be more personal with your response by talking about how passionate you are for something or why it's so important to you.  Don't put other people down – stay positive and focused on what makes you great.  Similarly, don't fire off a bunch of impressive sounding test scores/GPA/class rank stats.  Selective colleges get many applications with high stats and reject many of them.  If you have a strong theme/arc/narrative woven into your application, this would be a good place to delve into that.  You can also talk about the college community and what you might add to it.\n\n**8. Tell me about a time you struggled or failed at something.**\n \nAny response to a question about your weaknesses or struggles should be focused on your growth, what you learned, and how you improved as a result of it.  You can be honest, but you should try to stay positive.  It's probably not a good idea to talk about anything illegal, unethical, or immoral.  It's also transparent and lame to talk about a failure/weakness that is really a success/strength.  If I had to assign numbers, I would say ~5-10% of your response should be about the struggle/failure and 90%+ should be about what you learned, how you grew/responded, etc.  If you're following the Answer->Evidence->Interpretation model, the answer should be the only part where you really talk about the failure.  \"X happened, and it was hard, but I learned...\"\n\n**9. Where do you see yourself 5 or 10 years from now?**\n\nTalk about what you want to do after college, what kind of career you want to have, what you hope to achieve or learn, and what the impact of those things might be.  You don’t need to be unrealistic or overly lofty with the Nobels, Pulitzers, and elections you hope to win.  It can be simple and attainable, just make sure you are able to show how it will be meaningful to you and that you've put some thought into it.  Being personal and specific is more important than being grand.\n\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask in the comments."

    "body": "Hello r/gradadmissions,\n\nI'm a first-generation international applicant who recently completed a long graduate school application season and I’d like to share my experience. I applied to Master’s programs in Computer Science and some closely related fields. These kinds of posts helped me a lot when I was applying, so I hope this can offer a bit of insight (or at least some encouragement) to someone out there.\n\n*Note: This post roughly follows the structure commonly used in* r/collegeresults. *If you’re mainly interested in the outcomes - or if you come from a similar background - feel free to skip ahead to sections 5 (Admission Results) and 6 (Reflection)*.\n\n# 1. Background Information\n\n**Gender:** Male  \n**Nationality:** German  \n**Residence:** Small town in Baden-Württemberg \n**Personal Background:** No elite academic environment, no family ties to university, but a strong record of extracurriculars and academic development over time.\n\n**Education Path:** Hauptschule - Realschule - Gymnasium - Bachelor’s degree\n\n→ For those unfamiliar with the German school system: this path is quite unusual. I started in the lowest secondary education track (*Hauptschule*). Both *Hauptschule* and *Realschule* don’t qualify students for university. *Hauptschule*, in particular, carries a strong social stigma and is often associated with low academic expectations. Eventually, advancing to *Gymnasium* and earning the *Abitur* made me eligible for university.\n\n# 2. Academic Record\n\n**Undergraduate Institution:** Non-target university in Germany, but strong STEM curriculum  \n**Major:** Information Systems  \n**Minor:** Computer Science  \n**GPA:** 1.1 / 1.0 (German scale, with 1.0 being best); 3.93 / 4.00 (evaluated by an American evaluation service)  \n**Academic Honors:** Scholarship from one of Germany’s most respected foundations.\n\n**Research Experience:**\n\n* 4 months of nationally funded industry research, contributing to a published paper\n* 10 months of ML research (specifically XAI) at my university’s Chair of Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning\n\n**Professional Experience:**\n\n* 6 months internship (Data Science)\n* 6 months internship (Business Analytics)\n\n**GRE / GMAT:** Not required by the programs I applied to, so I didn’t take either.\n\n# 3. Extracurriculars & Community Service\n\nThere’s a lot, and it would take a whole new post, so I’ll just touch on that briefly.\n\nDuring my early school days, I started volunteering in my local church and joined our local sports club’s swimming division. Later, during *Gymnasium* (what one could roughly refer to as high school), I became a semi-professional athlete, eventually coaching young athletes and serving on the board of our local sports club.\n\nAt university, I joined the board of a national student association focused on education and helped shape the German education landscape for students across the country. I also started working as a volunteer programming tutor in my second year.\n\nMidway through my undergraduate studies, I began mentoring underrepresented groups in academia. Given my own background, this has always meant a lot to me personally.\n\n# 4. Statement of Purpose & Personal Statement\n\nThis one’s highly individual, and you should follow the outline you’re most comfortable with. Typically, the application portal will give you some guidance on what to cover in your statement.\n\nIn my case, I followed a structured outline. Depending on the school, I adjusted the focus. While each program required a slightly different perspective, I made sure that my core values and long-term goals came through consistently.\n\nFrom my point of view, there’s no blueprint that guarantees success. However, I’ve found it helpful to focus on a few key elements: personal motivation, academic foundation, relevant experience, and program-specific fit. Frankly, I think the latter is the most critical aspect to work on.\n\n# 5. Admission Results\n\n**Accepted:**\n\n* Brown (final decision)\n* Boston University\n\n**Waitlisted:**\n\n* Cornell Tech\n\n**Rejected:**\n\n* MIT\n* Harvard\n* Columbia\n* NYU\n\n# 6. Reflection\n\nLooking back, I realize that my goal was very ambitious. None of the schools I applied to would be considered a “safety” (at least as far as I’m aware). What mattered to me was how the programs \"felt\" (admittedly hard to put into words) based on the resources available, the way they communicated their values, and the atmosphere during virtual info sessions. With that in mind, these seven universities made it onto my short list.\n\nWhat’s worth mentioning is that this goal (to study at one of these universities) helped pull me out of a depression I had been suffering from for several years. I won’t go into detail here, but one day (still grateful for that moment) I realized that life holds far more possibilities than meets the eye. An article in a local magazine about American universities really piqued my interest. From that point on, I gave everything I had to build a strong academic profile. That was the very beginning of my undergraduate studies.\n\nHonestly, I don’t see myself as particularly brilliant compared to the many talented students around the world. I just worked hard, stayed as consistent as I could, and kept going. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was driven by this goal. Those three and a half years were, in a way, also the duration of my application journey.\n\nFrankly, I’m more than happy to join Brown’s Sc.M. in Computer Science since it was one of my three dream programs from the get go. Back in the day, when I started at *Hauptschule*, I didn’t even consider the idea of attending any university. It felt completely out of reach (at least, that’s what the social stigma suggested). Given my unconventional educational background and various extracurricular activities, the experiences I had have given me a unique perspective on life and learning.\n\nIn essence, I strongly believe that your path isn’t predetermined. It’s something you can shape through action. Search for opportunities to grow, be curious about different aspects of life, surround yourself with like-minded people, enjoy the ride (even when times aren’t that bright), and be grateful. If someone like me managed to achieve a goal like this, I bet you’ll do great once you get started!\n\nThat being said, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate you all! Best of luck with whatever comes next :)"

    "score": 54,
    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1mrvrqg/how_to_identify_a_suitable_mentor_whether_looking/",
    "body": "I am a full professor in STEM at USA University. This is what I tell my mentees about identifying strong mentors. In my opinion this is one of the most consequential decisions in academic life and at once one students have most control yet are most unprepared about. This is just my personal opinion. So other PIs are welcome to chyme in with different points of view. \n\nDear student:\nFirst thing is to look for active programs. Some schools are scaling back admissions due to budget problems (at least in the US). I would look for programs that offer teaching assistantships. These will guarantee you several years of funding (as a TA) even if you switch labs. \n\nThis will also give you teaching experience which is something you will need if you ever want a job where you will be teaching or managing other people. \n\nOnce you have some schools fit these basic metrics, you want to start looking at the faculty there. \n\nI would make a spreadsheet with faculty. You can find a ton of information from their websites. Things like publications: how many per year, what journals (impact factors: IF), who are the authors (grads, postdocs, undergrads, etc). \n\nLook at their website for current and former students. You can also get this information from their pubs (if they don’t have a pubs website, look on Google scholar). You are looking at their first and second authors in their pubs. Are these students? \n\nYou can youse chatGPT to help you. \n\nYou can ask and look up how many publications their students publish while there? How many first author, contributing author, etc. Some of those students likely are still in the lab (haven’t finished), others graduated. \n\nLook at their ones that graduated. Google them. Where are they now? Keep in mind that in academia up to 50% of the students who start a PhD will fail or bail, so don’t be put off if several of their students are MIA when you google them, but you should be able to find a healthy fraction year after year that are now gainfully employed. \n\nThis will be you in a few years if you go there. \n\nWrite all of these things down in your spreadsheet so you can compare lab to lab. \n\nLook at their funding. Do they have active grants? If they don’t that’s a bad sign. You don’t want to go somewhere without money. Look at NIH reporter and NSF grant browser. Those are the federal servers that let you find different PIs and their grant history. \n\nSpecifically, look at their active grants. Whatever the grant says the project is about, that is what YOU will be doing if you go there. That’s what their funding is for. If they don’t have grants, I would not go there. \n\nAlso look at how far back their lab has been around. You want someone established who has tenure. You don’t want to join a lab that’s three years old, and then your PI gets fired (doesn’t get tenure) half way through your degree. That happened to me and it’s not fun. \n\nLook at their website also for conferences abstracts. If they have that (some do some don’t) that’s also useful. This tells you which conferences you would be going and how often. Again you can calculate average number of abstracts per student per year etc. \n\nLook for information about awards and prizes for the PI (especially teaching/mentoring awards), but more importantly their students. Does the PI celebrate their students? All of these things give you insights on the type of mentor you are considering. \n\nNext look at their capabilities. \nYou want to list the types of techniques they use in that lab. You don’t want to end up a one-trick-pony. You want a well rounded education that will make you a competitive postdoc. \n\nLastly look at the type of questions they are going after. \n\nNote how I left this till the end. It was probably the first thing you would think to look for. But at this point in your career, while you do want to work on something interesting and exciting, for your future and career all the other things I listed before are actually more important. \n\nFor example, you might want to eventually do research on Alzheimer’s, but if a Parkinson’s lab offers a better education you should go there. You will become a better scientists and end up closer to becoming an Alzheimer’s PI than had you gone to the other one. By no means should you go somewhere you don’t find interesting, but there will be many things you will find interesting and you want to use that bandwidth to choose the place that makes you more competitive. A solid mentor is worth their weight in gold. \n\nLastly, contact alumni and present students. \n\nAsk them questions that give you useful information. Don’t ask they “do you like it there?” Or “is your PI nice?”  Everyone will respond yes. \n\nAsk them”what type of student does best in that lab? What do you wish you knew before you went to grad school? Again, some people will like the PI others might not. The questions should ask for facts rather than pure opinions. Be able to read between the lines. People who had a hard time will struggle to list actual things that were positive. They won’t have specific examples. They might not even reply. People who had a good time will give you specific examples of why they think the PI is good. Even negative feedback is useful, evaluate if this applies to you. For example, if someone complained about too much or too little hands on that might be a good or a bad thing depending on who you are and your style. \n\nBTW this is true of your letters of recommendations (a letter that says you are great but doesn’t produce specific examples of your “greatness manifest” are bad letters and won’t help you). If nobody responds to you, that’s a bad sign. \n\nBy this point you realize this is a ton of work. You will have a spreadsheet that will become thinner by virtue of what you uncover in your research. Maybe you end up with a list of 10-15 potential PIs that all look pretty good.  Rank them from best to less best. \n\nStart with the top 3-5. Craft an email that describes who you are, your interest and those skills that you have identified as useful in that lab. Then explain to them with your own words what they do and care about: “I see that you are interested in X, and use Z and Y to investigate W..” your job is to genuinely align yourself with their interests. If you get this bit wrong, you are toast (sorry). You will want to read their past few manuscripts. \n\nThis will show you what questions they will be going after (what do these manuscripts share in common?), and the techniques they use. If you read their grant, tell them I notice you are interested in (whatever their grant said they were interested in)… you want to show you two fit together. \n\nHere is where you also show them anything you can do. I am experienced in X (by the way, make sure you tell at least some of your letter writers to comment on your proficiency with X, whatever X is and assuming they know this). \n\nYou want to paint a mental image of you doing X in their lab and doing great work. If you did all this, you will be among a minority of well prepared candidates. If you do this for 3-5 PIs, and you have a modest to average CV, you should be hearing back from these people. At least some. Make sure you get at least one PI give you feedback on your email before you fire it to a potential PI. You get one shot to make this person interested so it counts that it is well crafted. Some won’t respond, some won’t have money or spots in their lab, but some will. \n\nDon’t try to reach out to too many at once. It is a lot of work and while nobody expects you to just reach out to one lab, reaching out to many shows you don’t know what you want. \n\nWhen you make contact, by mail or in person, Do your homework. Don’t ask them questions you can find the answers to yourself. Whether through the admissions website, their website, or elsewhere. If you become their student, they will certainly expect you to approach them only after you tried yourself. \n\nI hope this helps you"

    "body": "When decisions don’t go your way, it’s no joke. It can feel really awful -- maybe even like the worst pain you’ve ever experienced. As one of the members here in our community so eloquently and appropriately put it: “Not getting into the school you want f\\*cking sucks.”\n\nHere’s the deal: The only way through the pain is to go through it.\n\nYou know, I’ve never gone through the specific pain and frustration of the application process that some of you are going through, but I’ve had my share of fucked up shitty experiences when I didn’t know where to turn, and I’ve felt a lot of awful feelings. And here’s what I’ve learned. You can’t squash those feelings. You have to accept them and let them in in order to be able to process them and move through them. So basically as backasswards if this sounds, if you’re feeling kind of shitty right now, that’s great -- because it means that you are on your way.\n\nStill, remember this: You aren’t being rejected, your application is. These results do not define your worth. Period.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nThese are just a few of the ways I've learned to deal with tough situations. I felt like today would be a good day to share them with you.\n\n**Feeling Numb?** That numbness is your body and brain protecting you from pain, but it’s ok to feel the pain. In fact, the only way to get past the pain is to go through it. Basically, what you resist, persists. So, as hard as it might be, you’re gonna have to give in to the anger and sadness, and maybe even angry cry a little and bash some pillows. Also, what works for me is listening to angry music. I’m Gen X/Boomer, so Eminem, Smashing Pumpkins, and Linkin Park are my go-tos, but you have your own, I’m sure.\n\n**Go on a Bear Hunt:** In my family, we call getting through the pain, Going on a Bear Hunt. I don’t know if you know the children’s chant, but it’s about making your way through the tall swishy swashy grass and the thick oozy gooey mud and the fast-rushing river. To me, those are metaphors for the emotions we have to pass through as we make our way through anger, sadness, and disappointment. It’s like making it through the train tunnel; if you can’t go through that darkness, you get stuck there.\n\n**The RAIN Technique:** In Mindfulness, we use the RAIN technique to help go through the emotional process of dealing with pain.\n\n**R**ecognize your feelings.\n\n**A**ccept and acknowledge that they are there.\n\n**I**nvestigate them — what caused them, why are you feeling them\n\n**N**on—identify; know that they are just feelings, and feelings come and go. You are not your feelings. You are the observer of your feelings.\n\n**You are HUMAN.** Look, having feelings is part of being human. That pain and hurt and anger you’re feeling is part of your humanity, but those feelings come and go. They are ephemeral. What feels super shitty right now is going to pass, and on the reverse side, what feels super amazing right now is also going to pass. That’s what feelings do.\n\nBut you can also, think of your feelings like this: You are the sky. Your feelings are the weather.\n\n**What Can You Control?** Probably the most relevant lesson to the college admissions journey is the understanding that we can only control our own actions. Here's what you can control — essays, activity descriptions, grades, and test scores to a limited extent.\n\n**What’s Out of Your Hands?** You cannot control the number of other well-qualified students applying to the same schools as you or the institutional needs of the colleges on your list; you cannot control the mood, preferences, or predilections of the admissions reader.\n\n**“The Two Most Important Letters in College Admissions” IP – Institutional Priorities:** Colleges are creating a class, so they’re looking for people with varying strengths, abilities, talents, and backgrounds -- not a uniform set of people who are all robotically doing the same stuff. Also, certain departments and faculty might have more needs at different times. Or sometimes, board members and presidents tell them what they should keep in mind as they create a class. This is the part of college admissions we have no control over and why applicants need to not take any of it personally. [You can read more about what Rick Clark, former Director of Admissions from Georgia Tech has to say about IPs here](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2023/03/06/the-two-most-important-letters-in-college-admission/).\n\n**Forget About Dream Schools:** It’s not about finding the school of your dreams; it’s about finding the you of your dreams. When you’re drooling over that perfect school with a perfect campus and perfect classes, you’re not dreaming about any one school. You’re dreaming about who you want to be and where you can become who you want to be. I invite you to think deeply and figure out what it is about that certain school that makes you consider it your dream school — because I guarantee that your dream isn’t out there in the form of a college; it is in YOU.\n\n**Eat Ice Cream:** This is all to say, you’re gonna be ok. Allow yourself to be sad or angry. Sometimes schools make really stupid fucked up decisions, and it’s not a reflection on you, but that doesn’t make it easier to swallow right in the beginning. So be sad or angry. Smash some pillows, angry cry. Go through those feelings, and then go find ice cream -- or chips and queso, you do you. Because every year, after they’ve cried, pounded their pillows, licked their wounds -- and eaten ice cream, seniors come back here on a2c or send me messages and tell me about how even though applying to college was the most stressful experience of their lives, and even though the final outcome wasn’t what they were expecting, they are proud of how much they have grown and learned about themselves. And I have a feeling you’ll be one of those people too.\n\n**You Still Have Options:** I know you might not want to hear this now, but when you’ve gone through some of the pain and come out the other side, it might be helpful to know you still have some great options. You can choose one of the awesome colleges who have shown you love, take a gap year, go to your local community college, or apply to some of the many amazing colleges that are still accepting applications. I will be making a post with the list of NACAC college openings as soon as it's available.\n\n**The Name of a College Does Not Define You:** Now, there’s a lot of people around here in the world of college admissions who don’t agree -- but I am gonna argue this point (maybe that’s because I get old and cranky sometimes, I dunno.) College does not define you. You are the same badass today that you were last week and last fall and when you were five. And you’re gonna find yourself and grow -- no matter where you go to college, so don’t fall into the trap of thinking that the name on a sticker on your laptop or the bumper of your parent’s car defines who you are. It does not. And to parents, where your child goes to college doesn't define you either.\n\nAnd guess what? That doesn’t make the pain any better because you still gotta go through it -- which sucks. But, guess what again? Life sucks sometimes. And sometimes it’s really awesome. Axl Rose says it better, “Life sucks, but in a beautiful kind of way.”\n\n**Financial Aid Frustrations:** Sometimes your application decision might have worked out for you, but the amount of aid you’re receiving makes it an unavailable option. You can – and should – try to appeal your aid before moving on from a college. [Here’s a doc I have with some links and info about financial aid appeals or negotiation.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QF05tCqh9YxvR6Yo0_mpy8OZjWnF_vFBngKSCSobPoo/edit?usp=sharing)**Resources for you to check out if you’re feeling shitty:**\n\n**Feeling the Waitlist Blues, but wanna be a Waitlist Warrior:** Being waitlisted leaves you feeling kind of limbo – like what do I do with this information now? [Here’s my post from yesterday filled with tips and hints and LOCI info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1jlxou8/my_2025_waitlist_faq_and_top_tips_for_writing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nHere are some other resources for you to check out about dealing with this specific kind of admissions dissapointment.\n\n* [My YouTube recorded livestream with u/ScholarGrade about how to handle your decisions](https://youtu.be/zfOJlubzmhs).\n* [Livestream about Gratitude and Handling Shitty Situations with w/McNeilAdmissions, u/Ben-MA, u/ScholarGrade, and my favorite yoga teachers!](https://youtu.be/QYUma8_5V8E)\n* [Message from A2C mods on Ivy Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/tt6gv3/a_message_from_the_mods_on_ivy_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* My Reddit Post about Baby Trees and Lotuses: [You can handle this.

Admission Offices around the country have internal goals and requirements that they are looking for, and just because you don't meet them, doesn't mean you aren't going to be a great college student somewhere.”\n\nI’m gonna leave you with these wise words from [u/VanderVolted](https://www.reddit.com/u/VanderVolted/), from here on a2c[:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/) “Have you ever played a game where you won every time? It can be fun, but they don’t mean as much. Waitlist/Defers/Rejections suck, they really suck, but they make the good things ( whether they have to do with college acceptances, or even just completely separate things) much better.”\n\n**If you’re feeling so upset that you might do self-harm, Read This:** When you feel like life is beating you down like this, your brain actually makes physical changes and isn’t working properly. You can’t trust it to make wise decisions. It was described to me as if someone was putting heavy weight after weight on your brain - eventually, it’s going to collapse. So give yourself time. Give your brain time to heal. Talk to your parents, get to an ER, reach out to your therapist, or school counselor.\n\n**Resources and Hotlines**\n\n* National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK)\n* Online Chat: [http://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx](https://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx)\n* Crisis Text Line: Text \"START\" to 741-741\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines)\n\nTl;dr: When you don’t get the decision you want, it really hurts. The only way past that pain is to go through it. You have to remember that you are more than your college applications.\n\nXOXOXO AdmissionsMom"

    "body": "Hey guys! Got my final job rejection today so I figured I'll share some stats with the sub.\n\nPersonal Info:\n\n3rd year (Final year)\n\nEarly-Mid 20s\n\nMale\n\nRussell Group\n\nPredicted First 1:1\n\n2 years of experience in a start-up\n\n2 summer internships\n\n# Results:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgumqhijavqe1.png?width=2229&format=png&auto=webp&s=0226df63214f1d5eeb129551d637f7bbc491abcd\n\n\\*I'm only counting direct applications. Linkedin \"Easy Apply\" applications don't count in the stats here, as they take seconds and I don't think they lead to anything, so they're just a waste of time.\n\n# Time Spent on Applications:\n\nI've been using a time-tracking app to track most of my studying and job application time. The rest are estimates. While interviews and assessment centers are the most time consuming and emotionally draining, my most hated part is the application and job search part. At least with interview prep you're learning about companies and job sectors, but writing cover letters and optimizing keywords for CVs is so mind-numbing. Fun fact: I spent roughly 10% of my waking hours in the past 7 months on job hunting! FUN!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnynfi9lavqe1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e97fd54fd0109ea44e65f9613bda18f648dac5c\n\n# Some Application Stats:\n\nSome jobs were kind enough to report the number of candidates and positions they had. Every job opening had between 200-1250 applicants, which means you need to be in the top 99.5-99.9% percentile.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67jtmqnoavqe1.png?width=1974&format=png&auto=webp&s=79eb824efd5124869ba1b99bd2af30fe469f977f\n\n# Feedback Highlights from Interviewers:\n\nI usually ask for feedback from interviewers if I feel like I did really well or if I want to improve on some part of the assessment center (Group Work, Presentation, etc). Some feedback that I got:\n\n>\"The 4 interviewers in the 2 interview rounds loved you. They said you're a perfect fit for the position and would thrive in this program. You scored in the 98% percentile in the online test. Unfortunately, we only have 15 spots and 4000 applicants. You were top 20, if someone drops out, we might hire you.\"\n\nReally nice to know I got extremely close to getting the position but am still unemployed.\n\n>*\"In my view one of the strongest candidates I saw. Had clearly done a lot of research and was able to communicate it well. He as a strong candidate but it was impossible not to take his considerable previous experience into account. Should he progress to the next round, the team should press on why he is interested in a rotational scheme and what his goals are.\"*\n\nI don't really get this one. It's a bit hard to make yourself a good candidate without talking about your experience\n\n>*\"Candidate not suitable as is still in full time education, can't start full-time position in Feb/March\"*\n\nThis one really annoyed me. The position was posted as an internship with a summer beginning. I spent hours on interview preparations and felt like I smashed the interview. I was ghosted by the interviewer and had to contact HR to get feedback. Apparently, this is the only thing he wrote. Why waste both of our times when my graduation date is clearly visable on my CV?\n\n>*\"5 out of the 6 interviewers in the assessment center voted yes, 1 voted maybe.\"*\n\nThis just exemplifies how competitive the job market for graduates here is. This job required 3 stages, then 2 interview rounds, then 2 round assessment center. You need complete unanimity, and if even one interviewer is not 100% sold on you, you're out.\n\n# Conclusions:\n\nUsually, I'm a pretty positive guy. This is not a pity post, I just love stats. Also, I recently read an article that talked about Gen Z being \"the rejected generation,\" and honestly, it's hard for me to disagree with that from my personal experience.\n\nSeeing all of this data laid out in front of me like this does make me desensitized and demoralized though. I spent hundreds of hours of my life and filled my final year in university with anxiety for nothing. Just gotta keep going, I guess."

    "body": "Every once in a while, I’ll see posts about whether you should consider top-to-mid liberal arts colleges here as alternatives to Top-50 larger/research universities, and as someone who went to Swarthmore College (as did my younger brother), here are my pros and cons for why you should or should not prioritize applying to or selecting liberal arts colleges.\n\n**Caveats/My Background:**\n\nI’m a product designer (some of the things I’ve made: [https://buyfloat.com/](https://buyfloat.com/), [https://docreview.app/](https://docreview.app/), [https://publit.app/](https://publit.app/)), and I’m not a college advisor or professionally affiliated with any specific university, but I know that these handful of years can have a dramatic impact on life outcomes, so that is why I’ve always helped students over the last decade. I did spend half a decade volunteering and supporting first generation college students through a college access organization called College Track, so I do have some familiarity about general college experiences of students who aren’t ranked first in their graduating class. I do get higher ed insights from my best friend from high school who is on the Board at Caltech. The relative comparisons of LACs vs. large universities also come from knowledge about the experiences of top students who I met after college during my national fellowship years. I’ve also learned from my experiences helping students win national fellowships like the Rhodes Scholarship, Schwarzman, Gates Cambridge, Luce, Marshall, etc. These students come from ALL types of colleges and universities across the country. I should also mention that my father is a college professor in Indiana, so over my lifetime being from the Midwest, going to college out East, and working professionally out West, I’ve gotten broad insight into how college experiences translated to professional outcomes.\n\n**Pros:**\n\nMost top LACs are relatively similar in that they're small, and you get a lot more attention by the professors and/or administrators. Regardless of how cynical one might be about the 'college experience,' I do believe that you 'get an education' in many of them (the biggest takeaway is that you learn ‘how to learn’ quickly and thoroughly, which is going to be useful after you graduate in whatever you end up doing). Personalized attention from professors and/or administrators can lead to other great opportunities. You have four years to pause and work on yourself–where yes, you're arguing over seemingly abstract and theoretical ideas–but that should help 'train your brain' for the world beyond. Sometimes, you almost feel pressured to make sure you do your work thoroughly because there are fewer than 6 people in a class (you cannot ‘hide’). Over time, this compounds your ability to learn, execute, and perform well. I think it used to be that bigger corporations or those of the 'white collar economy' might not have considered top LAC grads as much, but now I see that they recruit from them (the world has flattened a bit more). From an employer’s perspective, when a student from Swarthmore gets a specific GPA, I have some idea of how much pain they can tolerate and/or how sharp they are. At LACs there are more opportunities for leadership and growth as a student. For example, my brother and I were the student body presidents in our respective senior year’s there. I have friends who were the student body presidents at Stanford. Their experience in attaining that position felt significantly more difficult than what we had gone through. All schools have traditional leadership roles like student body president or editor of the newspaper, but LACs simply have a lower denominator of those who compete for these positions. The BIGGEST pro in my opinion is–along the similar vein as the previous pro–that there are fewer people who are competing against you for all opportunities. Companies, graduate schools, internships, and post-grad programs do want some variance/diversity in their pool of selected candidates. Just as colleges might want students from every state (where it’s statistically ‘easier’ to come from Indiana vs. California, for example), post-graduate or external opportunities will compare you against your peers (other students at your LAC or other students from LACs). You are simply competing against fewer students. Yale Law School might give admittance to two Swarthmore graduates per year (out of the possible low dozens who apply), and while they may give a few more admittances to UC Berkeley graduates, the denominator of applicants from UC Berkeley is likely far greater than the low dozens from Swarthmore, making your post-grad journey a bit more difficult having attended UC Berkeley (I’m making up exact numbers here, but I know I’m generally correct). Another pro might be that if you were a varsity athlete in high school, a lot of D3 NCAA athletic opportunities are accessible. My brother and I were both sprinters on the track team at Swarthmore, and this was a crucial way for us to forget the work for a few hours a day (and likely perform better overall as a result). At Swarthmore specifically, I never felt high academic competitiveness. I did hear of terrible stories of friends who attended MIT, for example, but I would say most of my classmates at Swarthmore were highly collaborative and helped one another.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nIt’s harder to coast or get away with not attending classes or skipping over the work. This can be a pain for some people, but if you did go to an elite high school it’s not going to be as difficult for you as it would be for someone who went to a normal public high school as I had. This could be due to the nature of LACs or might be attributable to class size, but I do know of smaller schools (non-LACs) where students do not worry about skipping classes. My best friend from high school went to Caltech, and he did not feel very pressured to always attend classes while he was there. Some LACs are much more grueling than others. When you get into upper level courses, while college should feel easier, it’s not going to be as easy as if you were at a USC-type school, because you might have experiences when you are the only student or one of few in a class. That is, again, you can’t get away with not doing your work. Socially it could be difficult because you are around the same people who you at least recognize (by face) for four years. Sometimes, some degree of anonymity and larger student body numbers at a bigger school will allow you to make more ‘new friends.’ Some ‘normal’ or expected college experiences simply don’t exist at LACs, like football games. I personally think this is silly despite always watching them (and being let down by the Oregon Ducks every year–hopefully not this year), but it may be important to some of you. Some LACs have their own brand based on the types of students who matriculate there. I absolutely hated Swarthmore during the first day of my pre-college visit because I thought the students were ‘way too nerdy’ (for other reasons I was convinced it would be great for me so I ended up attending). Each type of LAC has their own brand or reputation, and you might feel the average type of student there is not who you might want to befriend (but I do think there is a group at every type of small school for everyone).\n\nMy general profile as an applicant in high school probably would not have made me the prototypical matriculant at an LAC or Swarthmore, and if I had the choice to do it all over again, I think I still would have chosen an LAC. I did have classmates who felt socially suffocated by the intellectual nature of Swarthmore, but I also had classmates who really thrived in a setting where you could open your brains and dissect whatever you wanted with others who were equally engaged. I remember spending hours and hours and hours debating whatever we were debating over those years. It likely made me smarter–or at least more articulate–to be around these types of students. While everyone looks at the top LACs as alternatives, I think the high-middle or middle tier ones are probably undervalued, and you should take a second look if LACs appeal to you at all. None of my friends from Swarthmore became friends based on academic abilities, intelligence, or achievement, yet most of us have done exceptionally well professionally beyond college. It’s both a tragedy and a wonderful opportunity that four years may dictate the rest of your life, so I’m hoping my input can help at least a few of you.\n\nAlso, if you’ve read this far, I want to tell you that college selection ultimately doesn’t matter that much if you decide early on that you will be persistent. If you always decide to push yourself regardless of whatever status you’re attempting to achieve, you will find success, given you get a little lucky. And I should add, as someone who grew up with some high potential classmates in southern Indiana… some of them simply did not consider colleges that were ‘too far away.’ Being geographically far away from your college should not be a primary reason to not consider your educational opportunity, generally. I think this rule probably applies to 90% of you… the problem is that it’s difficult to identify which of you fall in the 90 vs. the 10.\n\nBest,\n\nYJ"

My parents are divorced, and have a combined income of around 330,000, with my dad making up the larger portion of earnings (\\~180,000 as of a couple years ago, dont know how he makes at this moment). I live in upstate NY, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that makes my father and my family as a whole upper middle class, and probably would disqualify me from any financial aid (i think). \n\nI live with my mother, who has saved up enough money with the intention of paying for half of both my sister's and my tuition. Right now, my sister is in college (one of the cheapest public schools in the state) and my father is at many points skipping out on paying her tuition, making my mother cover it or making my sister take out a loan. So it raises questions in my mother's and my mind about whether he will be able to help cover half my tuition or if he will be able to cover it at all. \n\nI do not intend to go to an expensive private school and will most likely attend a public school. And I will work as hard as I can to pay for as much of the cost as possible. I am just worried that even with all of that, I won't even be able to afford a public school without enormous debt. \n\nI guess what I am really asking is, could my situation qualify me for any need-based aid? If my father doesnt pay my tuition and I don't live with him do I need to list him as a caregiver? I feel like my current household salary of 330,000 without knowing my specific situation, would be seen as a lot and disqualify me from any financial aid. \n\nAgain I am not very knowledgeable on how financial aid works, so any info would help."

Extremely grateful for the way my cycle turned out in this long and arduous process. I hope this sankey provides clarity for those in a similar boat. Good luck to everyone applying or re-applying this cycle.\n\n**My Main Concern:**\n\nGoing into the cycle, I was comfortable with my stats, but got in my head a lot about the lack of a research or physician letter of recommendation, especially with over 2k research hours. I thought it might invalidate the work I put in. Some posts on this forum emphasized the importance of either or both types of letters, saying it was especially difficult (even rendering apps DOA) for certain research-heavy programs. Here is some context: I spent 3 years working in a college research lab (typical grindset wet-lab procedures). However, the lab struggled to maintain personnel, and many post-docs/students were fired, eventually leading the lab to consist of only my PI and me. At first, this might look like a blessing to work closely with my PI, but it couldn't have been further from reality. Was placed under unrealistic expectations to keep the lab afloat and struggled to produce usable data with a looming research thesis deadline for my graduation. I made the difficult decision to leave the lab and find another opportunity for 3 months so I could graduate on time and submit my thesis. Sadly, when I requested my previous PI for a LOR, I was ghosted. Looking back, it might have been for the best. I made sure to explain this situation in a good chunk of secondaries and I was even asked about the lack of a PI letter in my interviews, but I tried my best to explain the misfortune and spin it into a productive lesson about feeling comfortable about having difficult conversations/making difficult decisions in the workplace. If you are in a similar situation, I know research environments can be brutal, but I want to help calm your nerves. Admissions know that, too. How you explain it matters a lot.\n\n**My Takeaways:**\n\nThis process is far from perfect, and many extremely qualified candidates fall through the cracks. In the same light, it is rare to feel like you have a \"perfect\" application by the time you apply. My best advice is to find the type of physician \"archetype\" you want to become and make that clear to admissions. These \"archetypes\" can be physicians who are also into public health, research, business administration, engineering, or (in my case) medical education. This not only makes your app cohesive but also very memorable. A solid chunk of my interviews focused on my medical education goals and experiences.\n\nUpdate letters are KEY for some schools. Not saying it's always an answer to your prayers BUT it can be the difference between an interview invite and not. I sent an update to one of my favorite programs (a research-heavy program funny enough) in December and got an interview invite in Jan a few weeks later. Ended up being my last interview and the program I'm matriculating to.\n\nThis process is humbling in many ways, and I was astonished to see how much my peers have accomplished during the admitted student weekends. I remain staunchly optimistic about the state of healthcare and medicine in this country in the future.\n\nHappy to answer any specific questions you may have about my app! Once again, good luck to those applying now! You got this."

    "body": "I’ve seen several posts here asking on how to go about their SOPs. Honestly, some of them are low effort posts that could use some whooping, but others seem genuine with their queries. Anyway, below is a soft guide on how to go about your SOP if you’re applying for a master’s program.\n\n *Disclaimer*\nThis post is focused on research-based programs. \nThis is entirely based on my experience. (Admissions to programs in Harvard, Columbia, CMU, GA Tech, UCLA, UCB, Umich etc.).\nAny other insightful strategies remain welcomed.\n\nNow that’s out of the way, I’d like to mention that there are often far more ‘don’ts’ than ‘dos’, when it comes to SOPs, making this type of writing difficult. Similarly, despite many writing centers in school, the appropriate strategies required for such essays are not adequately addressed, if at all covered in class. So, here's what needs to be done: \n\nIntroduction\nThis is the first part of your essay and where you table your reasons for applying to whatever graduate program. While it’s necessary to account for your motivation to join grad school, this is not the place to discuss your childhood aspirations leading up to your major and what not. Forget that; you already did that in your undergrad essay. Instead, use anecdotal evidence to describe a challenge or inkling you’ve previously encountered in your past research experiences, and would like to solve or explore. \n“If you don’t have a concrete research focus, you’ll most likely struggle with this part if not the entire SOP. Having a research interest is integral, not only to your SOP, but to satisfying the ‘fit’ part of your application. I can’t speak much on whatever interests you have, but make sure it’s well-thought out, or even better, brings forth a new angle of thinking. Remember, these schools want the best candidates that’ll uplift their school’s name and branding. So, for you that means putting your best foot forward when it comes to your interests.”\n\n After that you can go ahead and elucidate your research interests. When doing this, remember to first of all give a general view of your research focus, before finally circling in on the specifics. For instance, if your research focus is on Natural Language Models, it’s prudent to first inform the reader of such before you can niche down and cover the specifics. For example, you could say, “My primary research interest lies in Natural Language Modeling, with a focus on context-aware language representation, and low-resource language modeling. Large language models capture syntactic and semantic patterns in human language and these representations can be improved to make AI systems more accurate, efficient, and fair. In particular, I am interested in exploring how pre-trained transformer-based models like GPT can be adapted and fine-tuned for domain-specific and multilingual applications, especially in settings with limited annotated data.”\n\nThis gives the reader a comprehensive and detailed coverage of your research interests, thus a plus on your application if you’re the right fit. Subsequently, your SOP doesn’t get to the bottom stack, which is a disadvantage for your application.\n\nThe above covers the crucial attributes of a great SOP introduction. It explains your interests and motivations for the said program, while pitching yourself as a prepared and ideal candidate.\n\nI hope this helps the master’s applicants yet to begin working on their SOPs, or currently stuck. I’ll release the next part tomorrow. Thanks. \n\n\n "

    "body": "Hey all, I thought I would share a bit about my story to make a larger point of college admissions and self worth as things start to pick up this cycle.\n\nI want to talk about my story with college admissions starting from my profile in high school up until now, my junior year in college and make a larger point about how college admissions works and specifically, its flaws.\n\nTo make a long story short, here was my profile coming out of high school:\n\nGPA: 3.8 UW/ 4.1 W\n\nTest Score: None\n\nHigh school: Private, College Prep, Bay Area\n\nExtra curriculars: President model UN club, Dual sport athlete (Did get recruited, but turned all offers down), TA for advanced level computer science course at high school for two years. Self studied two 2 AP's totally on my own, and then some various jobs and volunteer work I did in high school.\n\nAnd so my college results!\n\nI got into some pretty good schools but nothing crazy. I don't want to name names because I don't want to make objective judgements with my subjective experience with my college admissions results but I ended up attending the \"best\" one of them (ya know based on the college ranking websites, what people think was prestigious, etc etc)... and it was really easy. My last semester there I was double majoring and quadruple minoring and I took 13 courses, some of them graduate level. As a result, I ended up transferring to a top end program for my students. So the big question - how could this happened and what does it mean for you?\n\nI think an important place to start with this is that most people I know, do end up going to their correct fit when it comes to college admissions. Almost all people I've kept tabs on from my high school end up saying their college is hard for them and few will transfer. And those that do, it's equal parts social or financial than for academic reasons.\n\nHowever, I think the problem with my application is from a college admissions pov, it's not that great. Think about it, model united nations, athlete but isn't coming through the recruiting pipeline, TA'ing, some random volunteering, jobs, these are all activities that college admissions officers see, yawn, and say \"next\" to. However, these activities are not any less valuable or not any harder than doing some maybe more intriguing things like research or whatever else crazy stuff you guys do to get into college nowadays. The reality is I was not, and still am not, a worse applicant or student than someone who played the game of college admissions better, it was just my work was systemically devalued under the perspective of college admissions officers. So then it's not surprising that someone with my profile was undervalued when it came to getting into college. I was working any harder when I was doing 13 courses at my private college than high school, but all of a sudden, I was suddenly more \"impressive\" when it came to college admissions for being the same person and putting in the same amount of work.\n\nSo that brings me to today. I ended up transferring to a top end public university, quadruple majoring in some top end programs I knew I had no shot of getting into out of high school. I am very happy with where I am because my work now thoroughly does push me to be a better student and challenges me appropriately (and no, my gpa isn't like 2.0 and I have a social life).\n\nSo, what are the key takeaways and what I am trying to say with this post?\n\n1. You are not any less important for what you do.\n\nCollege admissions poses a very toxic mindset of there being right and wrong things to do with your time because some stuff will be more \"valuable\" in the eyes of the admissions officers and some stuff \"cliche.\" But the reality is this way of thinking is really toxic and you should not judge your livelihood based on this perspective. Instead, do what you want to do regardless of what college admissions would think of it as frankly, college admissions is only really a part of your life for 1.5 years (out of all your years alive).\n\n2. College admissions is a very flawed system and it is inevitable some people will \"fall through the cracks\"\n\nI have a great relationship with my middle school admissions officer who said they were experiencing way more applicants in past years then every before. He told me he was trying to make the experience as objective (numeric) as possible but even then it was really hard to make a decision. However, there are going to be people that just don't fit this very narrow way of judging talent and that's college admissions officers fault for having a flawed system, not your fault for being talented and shining in the ways in which you want to.\n\n3. Who you are and your work will be the most important factor at the end of the day\n\nSo we get that college admissions officers have a flawed and specific way of judging talent but is it still important to \"play the game\" and get a great college name for yourself? No, because even if you do get \"robbed\" when it comes to college acceptances your grades and talents will clearly show your profile is fitting of someone that should be in a higher end environment. So to this, don't forget that you can transfer colleges if you are afraid this will be you and as soon as you get out into the real world all that will matter will be where you graduated from - not which colleges you got into out of high school.\n\n4. College admissions are not the be all end all, even if it will sting for a year or two\n\nI get it, I was down the A2C rabbit hole in high school and was devoting my life religiously to working hard and making the best college application as possible because of all the social pressure that comes from college admissions. But the reality is that what you do is going to matter far more than where you went when it comes to jobs or graduate school. That's because is more directly related to what you will bring to the table for your graduate college / future employer. Plus, if you are interested in attending grad school, where you go to grad school is going to be where people classify where you you went to college and your undergrad really won't matter (you won't want to be that people when asked where they went to college in their 20s or 30s has to stipulation where you went to undergrad as well). Believe me, almost all grad programs (even top tier stuff) care wayyyy more about your gpa and the amount of research you did in undergrad than the name of the school you went to.\n\n5. Consider going public!\n\nThis might seem like a bit out of left field but do not underestimate public universities, especially if you think you are someone like me that might be systematically devalued by college admissions officers. This is because public universities typically have much higher acceptance rates than their corresponding private counterparts meaning that you don't have to be as \"ideal\" from the lenses of a college admissions officer to get into a higher end program. Plus, there is a ton more social and academic mobility in a public university than my experience in private. As an example, if you take a 4.0 gpa student from University of Minnesota (not to pick on Minnesota, I just need an example) vs a student at an equivalently academically prestigious private college and assuming all else equal, Minnesota is easily going to be more impressive because being atop a sea of 50k+ students is way more impressive than beating out 2 - 10k students (not to mention Minnesota will probably be easier to get into with in the first place). Plus, the publics usually have larger alumni programs (and thus more likely to have really successful alumni to help you out) and way more name recognition when it comes to employment than a corresponding private college. This is important because it will make your application more memorable versus being from a great but ultimately forgettable or nationally unknown private college (with the exception of getting back into your college for their grad program). While I get it that public universities aren't typically seen a prestigious / fancy / exclusive than their private counterparts, when it comes to employment and graduate school opportunities, public is the way to go (plus not to mention, probably a way more fun social life and having more people will make it easier to find people like you).\n\nThanks for letting me ramble and talk about my experiences with the college admissions system. I'm not the best writer haha so apologies if some stuff comes off as clunky or repetitive. I would be happy to answer any question and remember that while in the moment it seems like everything, where you get into college on the first go doesn't matter as much as what you do when you get there and who you are <3."

    "body": "A student once confessed to me that they didn’t want to go to their first college interview. Despite their parents eagerly hyping them up, they were quite positive they'd have a nervous breakdown in the middle of the interview. It’s easy to be stressed about college interviews, but you’ve made it this far in college admissions, having surmounted obstacles like grades, extracurriculars, writing your essays, and putting together your application. Having a respectful, open, and casual conversation about all of that is much easier than you think.\n\nDon’t believe me? According to Sayaka Smith, a Tufts Undergraduate Admissions Officer, college [interviews](https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/inside-admissions/post/interviewing-part-3-advice-from-the-interviewers) “are meant to be informal conversations, and an alumni interviewer’s job is to get to know you as a 3D human being and tell us a little more about you.” That’s it! You won’t be graded or win points. This isn’t Jeopardy. Your interview isn’t on TV, although you might be on a screen.\n\n**(**[**Click here**](https://www.youtube.com/live/-PEjabSFcwI?si=y5CpvvlrWN-QJUI6) **to follow along in my YouTube Interview workshop!)**\n\nHowever, you do need to prepare for that informal conversation. So, instead of stressing, focus all that nervous energy on what you can do right now:\n\n# Before the Interview\n\n1. **Research the School’s Interview Process:** Lots of schools have different methods for the way they conduct interviews -- and some even have different interview deadlines, so you need to read their websites carefully. Put all of that information into a new “Interview” Column in your College Application Organization Spreadsheet.\n\n1. **Stay Connected:** You don’t want to miss any electronic communications from the college. You especially don’t want to miss news about college interviews. Start regularly checking your inbox, as well as your spam, social, promotional, and junk folders, for communications. Clear out your voicemail — or set one up and make sure your message is appropriate. Check your portal in case they leave info there.\n2. **Do the Interview!** There’s data out there showing a striking difference in acceptance rates for those who interview and those who don’t (if the opportunity is available to them). So, if the school offers you an interview, do it! Even if they say that the interview is technically “optional” (you do know that there is mostly no such thing as \"optional\" in college admissions language, right?).\n\n***Interview Prep***\n\n1. **Light Interview Prep:** You have to be careful during this part. The temptation to memorize monologues about yourself is real, I know, but don’t do it. DO NOT MEMORIZE. DO NOT REHEARSE. Why not rehearse?You’ll sound stiff, false, like a robot. Have you ever tried to have a conversation with someone who had a list of points they were trying to blow through no matter what you wanted to talk about? It’s not a conversation any longer. It becomes an awkward trap where one party is just talking at the other and everyone just wants it to be over. What you need to do is come prepared to talk about yourself. In the days leading up to your interview, think about why you love the school so much, how your academic experience, extracurriculars, interests, and ambitions demonstrate who you are. All of that will be much more interesting to the interviewer\n\n1. **Create your Magical, Story-Collecting Invisible Backpack:** Prepare ahead of time with your invisible backpack full of stories about you. The best way to answer a question is with a story about yourself. Think of lots of little stories about you that represent who you are and what's important to you. That way, you can pull them out as they fit the questions. DO NOT memorize them. Instead of thinking of specific answers to specific questions, try thinking of themes or collecting stories about yourself that you can share. Think of it as your magical story-collecting backpack that you wear to the interview. There's nothing memorized -- just stories that explore who you are and are brought to the forefront of your mind for easy recall.\n\n1. If you need some help to get those thoughts flowing, check out my lists of college interview questions I collect every year:\n   1. [Favorite Questions from College Interviewers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HqQXy_Sl6tNF-KGdwuJC6BJv4PYs9cGb/view?usp=sharing)\n   2. [Even More Interview Questions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SAVLPpfpm2Knz4i4DLZfSJLQ_k6_HmD3/view?usp=sharing)\n\n1. **Prepare a One-Page Highlights Resume:** If the college or the interviewer doesn’t explicitly tell you not to, I recommend having a “One-Page Just-the-Highlights” Resume ready to hand to the interviewer. This gives the interviewer something to refer to during the interview and later when they write their notes. Of course, some schools specifically say not to bring a resume, so be sure you read all the directions they send you. For in-person interviews, hand it to them when you first sit down. If they use it, great. If they put it aside and never look at it again, no biggie. For virtual interviews, you can make it ready to link in the chat (or you could send it to them ahead of time linked in an email). Save it as a PDF in a Google Drive, so you can link it in the chat or easily screen share. Make sure you share permissions for them to open it. I suggest letting anyone open it so you don't have to worry about whether they have the right email or not while chatting with you. If they don’t use it, it’s no biggy.\n\n1. **Get in the Zone:** The night before the interview, do the basic but essential preparation stuff — make sure your clothes are prepared. Go over the next day’s schedule and ensure you’ve given yourself enough time to get to the interview location and get into the right frame of mind. For virtual interviews, click on the Zoom link to make sure you know where it is! For in-person, plan out your route to get there and plan to arrive at least 15 minutes early. Get a good night’s sleep.\n\n1. **Do a Virtual Tour or Info Session before!** Go on the college's website and watch some virtual tours or sign up for an Info Session.\n\n1. **For Virtual Sessions, Practice with your Computer:** Make sure your camera works. Lift your computer enough so that you are looking into the camera at eye level. Practice with your mom or a friend. Make sure you have lighting in front and behind you -- especially in front of you. Put a lamp just behind your computer so that your beautiful smile is sure to show!\n\n1. **For Virtual Sessions, Arrange the Time and Space with your Family.** Let them know ahead of time that you'll be interviewing, so you'll need some quiet space for half an hour or an hour or so. Sit in a location where if your family has to walk around you, they'll be going in front of your computer, not behind you. Your interviewer definitely doesn't want to see your dad walking around in his underwear! If you are in your room, then make your bed and tidy the space.\n\n# The Day Of\n\n1. **What to Wear:** Wear something you are comfortable in and that makes you feel confident. You don’t need to wear a suit, but you must look tidy. Wear a clean shirt with a collar, tucked in, and if you’re in person -- a clean pair of pants or jeans with a belt (if you have pants other than jeans, wear them). You can wear a nice but not-too fancy dress, a clean skirt, or pants with a blouse or shirt, tucked in. NO inappropriate T-shirts or dirty, stained, or torn clothes. Clean up your tennis shoes. Consider removing piercings beyond ear piercings. Wash and comb your hair. Get a haircut if you need it. Shave or trim your beard if you have one. No need for anything too elaborate, but you must look clean and neat and not like you just rolled out of bed.\n\n1. **Bring your Questions:** As Finding\\_Snoo says in their [great post here on ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i77vhq/what_i_wished_i_knew_before_i_did_virtual/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), make sure to bring your list of uneasily googleable questions. If the information can be found on the website, don't ask. But it is okay to ask them to explain something or elaborate about something on the website. Personal questions that connect to the interviewer can be useful: ask about their favorites on campus and their experiences.\n\n1. **Get There Early:** For virtual, plan to log on 10 or 15 minutes early so you have time to deal with tech problems, make last-minute adjustments with lighting and camera angles, run to the bathroom one last time, etc. For in-person, early so you don’t stress out. Double-check your planned route. Plan ahead how early you need to leave to arrive 15 minutes early, and then leave 15 minutes before that time.\n\n1. **Superman It**: When you get there or when you’re all set up and ready to go on your computer, go take one last trip to the bathroom. After you take care of business, go look at yourself in the mirror, put your hands on your hips, and stand up nice and tall. [Do the Superman Pose](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superheroes/201107/why-you-may-want-stand-superhero) and take some deep breaths.\n\n# During the Interview\n\n***Make your Introductions***\n\n* Smile: Don’t force it, but try to relax and enjoy yourself a little. Again, this is just a little chat between you and the interviewer.\n\n* Make Eye Contact: This is important and can be tricky on a virtual chat. Resist the urge to watch yourself in the video and keep your focus on your interviewer. Make sure you look the interviewer in the eye so they know you’re engaged and paying attention. Not too much. It’s not a staring contest. Be confident but natural.\n\n* Introduce yourself. The easiest and most confident way to do this is to state your name during the handshake if you’re in-person, and for virtual, just wave, smile, and say something like Hi, I’m Carolyn. Nice to meet you! (but don’t use Carolyn, that would be ridiculous unless your name is Carolyn.)\n\n* Shake hands. If you’re in-person and you feel comfortable with a handshake, you can stick your hand out, but remember not everyone is comfortable with this level of touch, so be respectful.  Think of a good handshake as about the degree of firmness you would need to hold onto a doorknob to open a door. A little bow is fine, too.\n* Be Engaged\n\n* Silence and put away your phone: (The only exceptions would be something like they ask to see a picture of an art project you did and you happen to have one on your phone. Make sure there’s nothing potentially embarrassing to scroll past!)\n\n* Remember to breathe.\n\n* Keep Smiling and Making Eye Contact: Consider your non-verbal communication. Nod, lean in to listen, and use your hands to speak. If you’re interested in learning a little more about nonverbal communication, [here are my short notes from a recent webinar I went to about nonverbal communication and body language.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qp-0Nx2fsI1mk9WUn-7OCfxs0qsWnFhG/view?usp=sharing)\n* Listen to your Interviewer: Respond to the questions. The numero uno thing colleges tell us to share with you is to LISTEN to the interviewer! Don’t come with an agenda of what you want to say or come off as overly-practiced or memorized. They could end up noting that in their write-up.\n\n* Lean into your nerves: Own it. Being nervous is okay. You can tell the interviewer if you're feeling a little nervous. This will help them know to help you along. They don’t want you to fail. More than likely, they've been nervous about something really important to them a time or two, too.\n\n* Take Notes: It's okay to take occasional notes as you're talking in case there's something you want to come back to, but be sure you aren't staring down the whole time.\n\n* Remember to Breathe. Make sure you're continuing to breathe. There's no rush.\n\n* As it ends, thank them and make sure you have their contact info.\n\n# After the Interview\n\nWrite a Thank You Note After The Interview. If you meet in person, ask for a business card so you can jot down a quick thank you note and send it when you get home. Try to send an email that evening or afternoon or the next morning. Be gracious, be grateful for their time, and be specific about something they said that made you think about or particularly excited about the school. Thank them for taking the time to talk to you. Be friendly and warm. Use good grammar. Don’t worry if you don’t hear back from them. It doesn’t mean anything at all.\n\nAnd That’s It! See how direct and simple this is once you divvy up what you have to do? After you’ve handled that huge college application checklist, this interview process will be a piece of cake. If nothing else, you’ll feel more confident, which will make you a more engaging and exciting interviewee.\n\n**Oh! One More Thing!**\n\nI get asked all the time about how important interviews are. And, of course, the answer to that question, just like in pretty much all things college admissions, is it depends. Interviews with admissions counselors from colleges are indeed important and they will be accounted for in your evaluation -- as far as how much? Who knows -- back to “it depends on the college.” In my experience, alum interviews are a great time to get to know more about the colleges and share a little about yourself, but not a whole lot more. I think a horrible interview could tank you, but beyond that, not too much. Many kids I know have had alum interviews that positively rocked, and they still weren’t admitted and other kids have had alum interviews that they felt were very ho-hum or even worse, and they were admitted. So my point is, don’t overthink it. Think about these interviews as life practice. Not as making or breaking your college apps.\n\n  \nI'd love to hear you interview worries, stories, favorite questions, mishaps, and things that went well!\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nBe early. Smile. Breathe. Bring a magical backpack filled with your stories. Listen. Breathe. Write a thank-you note.\n\n"

For context, I'm going down the biology/environmental science road, so 99% of schools require you to reach out to a specific professor to see if their lab is accepting grad students and they can take you on as an advisee. I feel like I'm just sending emails out into the void. It takes a lot of time and effort to research these schools and then find professors and learn about their research and I send them an email expressing interest and...nothing...\n\nI've gotten a few responses saying that they aren't accepting new grad students (most of those were last year, hence why I am in the position I'm in).

I had a nearly 4.0 major-specific GPA with a 3.7 overall, and i have two bachelors degrees, with the one i was trying to pursue graduate studies having an honors distinction. I also had quite a bit of extracurricular leadership experience from other organizations in my undergrad career.\n\nSo, I thought, with all of that, \"Oh, well, I'm sure to get in *SOMEWHERE*!\"\n\nSpoiler: I did not (lol). I received my last rejection yesterday, after having been put on a waitlist originally about a month prior. One school I still haven't heard from, but I don't expect to, nor was I planning on going if I were accepted.\n\nSo...yeah. I'm absolutely disappointed, at least a little. And I'm certainly a little angry at the fact that most (if not all) of those rejections were probably due to the funding issues going on.\n\n**However.**\n\nI'm approaching this whole situation with a particular point of view (and I do risk sounding a little bit not self-aware, here, but I will take that risk): **\"There is very little chance that any of this outcome is my fault.\"** I know I did my best, that I'm a strong applicant, and most importantly: *I know that the outcome of what happened was purely out of my control.* I think the situation of me being a senior in high school in 2020 - and therefore having to pivot my plans for where to go for undergrad - has changed my perspective when things like this happen.

What matters more is what I choose to do about it.\n\nI'm sharing all of this because I've been watching this subreddit, seeing people like me get rejected from schools, having their offers rescinded, and even more people being in danger of having to move back to their home countries given their student visas expiring when they graduate.

Because the most important thing right now is to keep a sense of community, especially when times like this happen.\n\nOverall, though, I'm sending love to everyone here, and everyone being affected by the bullcrap of the US. **We will get through this.** <3"

    "body": "**TLDR: There are boxes to be checked as a pre-med, but please let this be proof that your non-medical interests** **are extremely valuable.**\n\nHi everyone!\n\nI've been apart of this subreddit since I was a freshmen in undergrad, and being able to finally post a Sankey feels so so surreal. I got my final decision back yesterday, and have been so excited to talk to other applicants on this forum that are similar to me. I'm going to breakdown some of the things I think made me successful, some of the things I could've done better, and in general, some things I wish I knew when I was where all of you are!!\n\n# STRENGTHS\n\n\\-ECs/life experience\n\n* I would search through Sankeys each year, and get nervous that my ECs didn't look like the ones that successful applicants had. Ultimately, I decided I didn't care. The activities I think made me standout most were:\n   * Exec member of Greek life\n   * 5 years of Experience as a D1 athlete and captain, especially one who suffered a pretty severe injury and bounced back\n   * Heavy involvement and leadership coordinating arts events, ultimately choosing an artistic minor and spending hundreds of hours on different events\n   * Advocacy work with sexual assault on a university and governmental level\n   * Teaching at an elementary school for a year\n   * Two research publications in MFM field\n\nAll of these activities were discussed more than any of my clincial work, research, or shadowing experiences (which I had plenty of, and got very lucky to wrack up hours and pubs in during my time off of school). **I took 2 gap years before applying because I didn't want to feel rushed, and wanted to have time to wrack up hours in the areas that I needed to before applying\\*\\***. I ultimately think the stories I was able to tell as a result of all of these activities is what made me successful.\\*\\* I didn't have to think all that hard about answering secondary or interview questions, because all of my stories were pretty unique. Most importantly? I had so much fun doing all of this.\n\n\\-LORS\n\n* My letter writers were mentors that I've known for almost 5 years in research positions, athletic team settings, art programs, and professors in my major. I had a few of them ask me if they could write a letter for me, and in general, had interviewers remark on how personal my LORs were. I focused a lot on building relationships with these people outside of a medical school setting, and it paid off well!\n\n\\-Writing\n\n* I can't even tell you how many drafts of my PS I went through before submitting it, but I know I sent it to like 10 different people. I have a lot of friends who are humanities majors, and I made sure to have them rip it to shreds with their editing. I agree with current advice that there is such thing as too much feedback, but I felt secure knowing I was submitting a PS that had been seen by people from a bunch of different backgrounds, and I got comments on how cohesive and descriptive my narrative was!\n* Secondaries: Even though I submitted everything by mid-August, I made sure that each essay I was submitting had been edited and reviewed by a handful of people, and was strategic with which ECs I mentioned for each school. I took the approach of highlighting activities that I thought aligned well with a school's mission, which I think worked out in my favor!\n\n# WEAKNESSES\n\n\\-Not enough interview prep\n\n* At a certain point I started to slack with prepping for each specific school, and I think my interviews towards the end of my cycle were not as strong as the ones in the beginning. Try to stay consistent with your routine, and if there's a school you know you don't want to attend, save your energy and decline the interview offer.\n\n\\-Stats\n\n* Again, I know I might get some pushback for putting this down as a weakness, but it's what my advisor kept bringing up to me. For the schools I was applying to, I was always bottom 10th or even completely absent from those little MSAR charts. My stats are fine for the majority of the schools in the country, but I received a lot of pressure from my advisor to retake my MCAT. I decided not to because that shit was #ass and I wanted to focus on my ECs instead. It was a gamble, but one that I think worked best for me.\n\n\\-Unfocused narrative\n\n* I had two interviewers at the same school mention they were confused by my motivation for medicine because of the non-medical activities I'd taken part in, and how my didn't paint a clear picture. I knew this was a risk I was taking by having so many non-medical activities on my application, and I ultimately caught the R from that school. I'm deeply passionate about education and mentorship, and created a narrative that showed that theme throughout my life in every facet, but I know that a student who is more traditionally research and clinically focused is what some schools are looking for. Completely and totally fine, but that is simply not me!\n\n# PARTING WORDS\n\nAt the end of the day I made it through the application cycle and my premed journey with not just my sanity, but also genuinely enjoying who I've become and feeling extremely happy and fulfilled. I would not have it any other way, and believe the schools I was accepted to are the ones that align best with who I am and what I hope to do in my life (spoiler alert: be happy). As pre-meds, we are WIRED to go hard at everything we do, and what I hope to do is provide some comfort for people who feel like they have to set their passions aside in pursuit of medical school. You don't. You shouldn't. You are an amazing person, and you deserve to follow whatever path you want to medicine. There is no rush, there is no right way to do it. :) I wish everyone well and am so open to questions!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzzlfrmoauoe1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6276151530c7b2de108493fcdde5ad18bb2d06bb"

    "body": "Hi everyone, I am a reapp having a hard time passing the interview stage, and I’m not sure what to change. I had 13 interviews, 7 waitlists, and 0 acceptances when I previously applied in 2024-2025 to MD/PhD programs. This cycle, reapplying to MD, I have completed 2 interviews, 1 turned rejection, and 1 still pending. I am wanting to please ask you all:\n\n1. What am I doing wrong and how can I do it better?\n\n2. What can I still do this cycle to get more interviews (although it is early and I already have had 2!)?\n\n3. Which if any schools are worth adding for me in October?\n\n4. How much about my manuscripts/pubs can I update schools about?\n\nCould you please read the below and let me know your advice? Thank you so much!\n\n\n\nHow I’ve addressed it and how it's going\n\nI have discussed my cycle results with colleagues, mentors, family, and friends and we think my struggles are caused by poor interviewing skills and/or cuts to federal funding for biomedical research. \n\nSince I can control my interviewing, I am trying to improve that. I have practiced SDN questions a lot more this cycle for 2 interviews I have completed in September (very grateful). I found a helpful reddit post for preparing for interviews, and I already do most of what it says but not everything. For possible future interviews, I will take the remaining advice from that post and continue prepping a lot. This includes practicing my answers to common interview questions and looking directly at the camera (I was not totally doing that at first). A lot of people in my life did say I speak well and seem knowledgeable and passionate about science and medicine when speaking with me and in a mock interview. This is what I am currently working on.\n\nI decided to ask for advice here because I was rejected from one of my interviews this cycle. It was MMI style and at one of my state schools the University of Missouri Kansas City. I practiced a lot for the MMIs by finding advice for how to answer them and common questions online, outlining my responses, and practicing speaking them out loud to people and the camera. I feel like it went ok - I answered questions exactly how I practiced and every interviewer laughed or smiled a bit (I tend to be kindof a funny guy with an expressive, dynamic, effervescent personality which could also be negatively impacting me). My stats are a lot higher than their range, but I would have loved to attend the school. We mostly think it’s yield protection, lack of fit being research heavy, or I didn’t answer the questions as well as I thought I did. This is how my interview prep has panned out so far.\n\n\n\nMy WAMC\n\nDemographics and additional info\n\n* Age: 24 years old\n* Gender: Man\n* Race: White (not Hispanic or Latino)\n* State of legal residence: Missouri\n* USA Citizen\n* Proficient in English (native speaker) and Spanish (college minor)\n* Not disadvantaged at all\n* Both of my parents are living and have graduate degrees from the University of Missouri system.\n* My sister is a 26yo woman.\n* No previous matriculation\n* No institutional action\n* No felony, no misdemeanor\n* Nothing military\n\nAcademics\n\n* WashU undergrad Aug 2019 - Dec 2022, biology major, Spanish minor\n* I graduated 1 semester early senior year.\n* I was in college for the entirety COVID, so I took many courses online, including prereqs.\n* BCPM GPA: 3.91, 79 hours (3.77, 26hrs -> 4, 21hrs -> 3.92, 16hrs -> 4, 16hrs)\n* AO GPA: 3.83, 47 hours (3.47, 9hrs -> 3.87, 23hrs -> 4, 12hrs -> 4, 3hrs)\n* Total GPA: 3.88, 126 hours (3.69, 35hrs -> 3.93, 44hrs -> 3.95, 28hrs -> 4, 19hrs)\n* 21 P/F hours all passed (all just elective, supplemental courses, no prereqs), 12 AP hours\n* MCAT taken on 8/26/23: 520 (CP: 131, CARS: 127, BB: 130, PS: 132)\n\nActivities\n\n* Awards include NIH Postbac Program for over 2 years, nominated for a national volunteering award in hospice volunteering but did not win, competitive but internal summer research fellowship in undergrad, latin honors and research emphasis in biology with a research thesis, state level academic scholarship\n\n\n\n* 3 publications, 2nd 2nd and 3rd author, basic science / immunology, impact factor average is 6.23\n* 1 manuscript under revision (now accepted), 2nd author, basic science / immunology, impact factor is 6.1\n* 1 manuscript submitted (now under review after revision), 1st author, basic science / immunology, impact factor is 6.5\n* 1 manuscript in prep (now under review), 1st author, basic science / immunology, impact factor is 5.1\n\n\n\n* 6 posters at national and internal immunology/research conferences\n* 4 presentations at internal conferences\n\n\n\n* NIH Postbac Program full-time basic immunology research for 4600 hours (now more like 5300) (Most Meaningful Experience)\n\n* Undergraduate Research part-time basic immunology research for 1700 hours (Most Meaningful Experience)\n\n\n\n* Hospice volunteering for 360 hours (now more like 386hrs) (Most Meaningful Experience)\n* Hospital volunteering for 250 hours\n* Shadowing for 80 hours across radiation oncology (38hrs), medical oncology (32hrs), rheumatology (5hrs), and neurosurgery (5 hrs) \n\n\n\n* Community volunteering for 114 hours\n\n* Computer science teaching assistant, paid, 3 semesters, 2 different 200-level courses, for 400 hours\n* Leadership position for school’s premed club for 90 hrs\n\n* Hobby is listening to rock music and going to concerts\n\n\n\nI would love to share my writing for any activities, personal statement, or secondaries with you in DMs if you are willing to provide feedback and are curious!\n\n\n\nLetters from 2 PIs, 2 science profs, 1 non-science prof, 1 director of hospice services (all know me well and personally), committee letter packet with cover letter\n\n\n\nSchool list\n\n* U Missouri Kansas City -> Interview (completed) -> Rejected\n* U Missouri Columbia -> Interview (completed) -> Pending\n* UCSD -> Pre-II hold\n* Case Western -> Rejected\n* Lerner -> Rejected\n* U Chicago -> Rejected\n* U Michigan\n* Northwestern\n* U Penn\n* WashU\n* Cornell\n* U Miami\n* Yale\n* Stanford\n* Mt Sinai\n* Dartmouth\n* Georgetown\n* Rosalind Franklin\n* U Iowa\n* Ohio State\n* Tufts\n* East Virginia\n* Harvard\n* Vanderbilt\n* Columbia\n* UVA\n* Pitt\n* Emory\n* Penn State\n* GWU\n* Brown\n* Johns Hopkins\n* UCSF\n\n\n\nPossible problems\n\n* Poor interviewing\n* research heavy\n* No leadership position in clinical or community volunteering\n* Not enough clinical and volunteering hours\n* Low GPA\n* top heavy\n* lack fit or am yield protected for my “broad picks”\n* Possibly cookie cutter / normal / basic\n\n\n\nWhat I could do\n\n* Send an update about my accepted pub\n* Practice interviewing\n* Create a more balanced school list (please give me recommendations!)\n* Switch from a full time basic science job to a clinical job\n* Become a leader in clinical or community volunteering\n\n\n\nPlease let me know what you think!

    "body": "College apps are stressful. I get it. In fact, I was here so much myself as a junior and senior in high school that I still get DMs from half a dozen high school students a month, who have found my profile on Reddit from various things I posted or commented on here years ago. When I have a little bit of extra time, I try to answer. It’s my way of giving back, in exchange for all the wonderful anonymous internet advice I received myself 2-3 years ago. \n\nBUT: There are some guidelines that clearly need to be set. You are all so, so desperate to appear as wonderful humans to AOs, that you forget being a wonderful human begins with your daily, personal behavior. Including on Reddit. I know I don’t speak for all former applicants on here! But hopefully many will agree with some of these comments. \n\n1) Be grateful. If I take the time to answer your questions, please respond. If I share details of my application with you, please say a genuine thank you. I do not owe you my personal info, energy, or time. Do not ghost me if I give you a detailed answer. \n\n2) Do NOT DM people to answer easily google-able questions. If your question can easily be answered with five minutes on the internet, I’m not responding to you. \n\n3) As an extension of #2, do not DM questions about my own application process that can easily be found if you spend five minutes on my Reddit profile. This may not apply to all college students on here obviously, because some people haven’t shared as much. But as someone who has given a truly ridiculous amount of info to this sub (including my stats, test scores, and accepted universities — all multiple times), I find it ridiculous when people DM me questions about basic info in my application. \n\n4) Come with a specific question. I am not an admissions officer. I am not an oracle. I can speculate about what got me into X, Y, or Z college, but I have no clue what you’d specifically need to stand out. Stop asking for “advice on applications” or “advice on essays.” That is vague and honestly I’d have no answer for you. And the best part of A2C is honestly that it’s a crowdsourcing platform! Many people DM questions that I think they’d be legitimately better off asking to the whole community. \n\n5) I will not share any of my essays. Period, the end. I draw the line at a one sentence summary of the topic.\n\n6) On the note of specific questions, keep in mind that I (and other people you reach out to) applied to college years ago. I no longer remember what “option A” and “option B” are of the supplemental essays of a specific school, which may or may not have changed its prompts in the last few years. I took a version of the SAT that no longer exists. Please provide details, and consider whether your question would be best answered by a more recent admit before DMing. \n\n7) If I give you an answer, do not ignore it or argue with me because it’s not an answer you’re happy with. I assume you reached out to a stranger for a reason. If you want to have your answer dealt with a hug, ask a teacher or a family member. \n\n8) r/chanceme exists for a reason. Do not copy your entire application into my DMs and expect me to sit there evaluating it when there’s an entire internet community at your fingertips who’s already offering.\n\n\nI’m not making this post to be mean. But I often think high school students on here forget that I’m not some college admissions expert chatbot. I’m not getting paid to respond to people. I’m not getting paid to read your app. I don’t even really have specific or updated expertise on the college process. Please remember that the people you DM on here are people too. \n\nOther grads/college students — feel free to add anything I missed in the comments!"

I've checked with r/firealarms and the consensus is that screwing the emergency door release to render it inoperable breaks all fire codes. Considering how dilapidated the doors are, the sensors sometimes don't detect and you have to wave your arms around.\n\nI'm not exactly a fan of talking to the director of residence life as he is quite rude more than anything and has a tendency to brush off issues even if they are serious and honestly, I have 0 idea on what I would say to him other than that this is against the law.

    "body": "Hey guys, I had the amazing opportunity to tour 8 colleges a last week! I know not everyone is lucky enough to get to tour the schools they’re thinking about applying to (perhaps maybe ED/REA), so I thought I’d share my experience and what stood out to me! Not sure how helpful this will be but hopefully it’ll provide at least some info for someone out there! Fair word of warning - these are kinda long bc I tried to be as detailed as possible, so pls skip to whichever school(s) interests you! \n\n**Brown:**\n\nInfo Session: OPEN CURRICULUM is the main thing here, the thing that makes Brown different. Aside from your major reqs (which you have to declare after 2 years), you can take any courses in anything. You’re completely free to explore your true passions and find what YOU want to do at the intersections of fields. Since people only take classes because they want to be there, it leads to a much more engaged classroom. Collaboration is a huge thing - since everyone is doing their own thing and following their true interests, competitiveness is pretty nonexistent. There’s a robust advising system in place due to all the choice so that students still stay on track. The tour was cancelled, so we had a student panel instead. Since the stuff they said is about Brown and not about the area/buildings, I’ll put it here under info. First off, let me say, holy hell. I almost switched my ED to Brown. You are either going to love the Open curriculum and Brown, or hate it. There is no in-between. These people seemed… so happy. Two were premeds (one PLME), one was prelaw, but they all seemed happy. I’ll paraphrase the PLME guy’s “why brown”: “I went to a very competitive high school, and I was doing all the things, running the race, top of my class, etc. Then I had to decide: did I want four more years of the same? Or did I want to be happy? I chose happy. \\[talked about his time at Brown for a while\\] Oh yeah, and I am happy.” Other premed guy was really happy too - they all were. As a girl said, “Here, your success does not depend on someone else’s failure.” And get this - they all still had insane ECs and involvements, research (80% of undergrads do research!), etc. Another girl explained this, and she said that since here, they were free to explore their true passions, all the other things they did WERE their hobbies, their social time, what they did for fun. They all truly loved everything they did. I truly love what I do in HS, but I definitely want to be surrounded by a community of people like that too, instead of all my depressed HS peers. And I want to be happy. Since everyone is so busy doing their own thing, it’s a really diverse space - everyone’s always doing their thing and nobody gets judged for it. They can take any class P/F, so grades aren’t really an issue, and they have like an 81% med school admit rate, and \\~80% to law school. Their students end up being competitive applicants for grad/professional programs despite being in this environment (or maybe because of it), and I think that’s poetic and beautiful. I ultimately decided against ED (sticking by my first ED choice - the polar opposite of Brown) because it’s like they say. You can take the kid out of the gunner environment, but you can’t take the gunner out the kid. Or something like that.\n\nSurrounding Area: Similar to Yale in every way (see Yale for more details). City that isn’t too big or too small - with enough bustle to be a city, but not enough to be overwhelming. Gapped row houses. Maybe a tad more crowded around campus? Student panel said the city itself is very artistic and creative, and has the most cafes per capita out of any city (didn’t fact check). Weather is also good - you get to experience all 4 seasons for sure. Basically - weather, art, and food.\n\nCampus Tour: We didn’t have a formal tour, but still wandered around campus, so here’s my thoughts of the campus. Again, it’s very much like Yale, maybe smaller. Roads run through the campus - it’s not a bubble. But it’s not overwhelming either - a nice Goldilocks zone. The med school buildings are pretty integrated into the undergrad stuff - we walked by a bunch of labs, undergrad buildings, and med school buildings all together. So there’s no clear separation of campuses like UPenn.\n\nKey Takeaways: Open Curriculum works, makes the environment way less competitive/stressful while still preparing students really well, not just academically but with ECs/research too. They genuinely seem happy. More so than anywhere else. A space where you’re free to be yourself, where they don’t expect you to have your life figured out at 17/18 - just your passions.\n\n**Columbia:**\n\nInfo Session: Didn’t have a formal info session, but a lot of what the tour guide yapped about was stuff that is usually covered in the info session (minus the admissions part), so I’ll put it here. 12000 in College (Arts & Sciences), 4000 in Engineering. Core curriculum for both, though College is more broad and Engineering is more applicable to engineering. Theme/mission for engineering is “engineering for humanity” - serving by applying knowledge to the real world. Lots of design projects in engineering. There are 200+ research centers, and labs are required to hold spots open for undergrads. Cold emailing works and usually the first one is a “yes.” There is a PE req and a swim test (for College only). There is guaranteed housing for all 4 years - 90% stay on campus. Everyone is assigned a general academic advisor who oversees and is the main point of contact, a major-specific advisor once you declare your major after the 1st year, and a pre-professional advisor for anyone going into grad or professional school. There is usually no class on Fridays, which are more of an “internship” day - lots of students get internships with the big firms like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, finance firms, etc. based in NYC - an upside of the location. Columbia students and classes (especially the core classes, which average 16-18 students) have a lot of philosophical discourse.\n\nSurrounding Area: I LOVE NYC. Baltimore and Philly were some other big towns I saw, and I gotta say I did not love those (especially Philly). But NYC was just… such a change from what I’m used to, in a good way. It’s relatively clean (there aren’t heaps of trash in the streets), and there are so many people everywhere, doing the most random things. Anyone from homeless people to businessmen to people jogging back and forth in front of a block. Everything is so close together and there are so many things everywhere. Definitely no row houses here like Baltimore and Philly - just apartments. I saw a subway for the first time!! (Though I didn’t get to go on it). I will say though, the drivers are terrible. Everybody jaywalks, and it’s impossible to drive past a crosswalk because there’s always someone crossing it when they’re not supposed to. And you also can’t go 30 seconds without someone cutting you off (and then they have the audacity to honk at you…) Traffic is also absolutely terrible, made worse by how aggressive the drivers are. But overall, I love the feel of NYC. Where I live, there’s a sense of isolation, because you’re always alone and everything is so far away. But with so many people here, always driving and walking somewhere, you’re never alone. There’s a sense that you’re a part of something bigger, something better, and I love that. Also, I don’t think you can beat NYC in terms of internship opportunities and industry.\n\nCampus Tour: It’s a decently sized campus, but it’s majestic and grand. Not in an old crumbly castle way though - in a regal way. Like you’re looking at something historical, but instead of looking depressingly old, it looks mighty significant. I really love the architecture here. They have different buildings for all the subjects - the Engineering building has the different Engineering branches on different floors. Campus is definitely somewhat of a bubble and not very integrated into NYC, but it’s right outside the gates. Overall I really love the campus here.\n\nKey Takeaways: NYC!! Nice for a large city, bustling, lots of internship opportunities due to the location. Campus is a great size and architecture is exactly the kind I like. High emphasis on core curriculum and getting exposure to lots of different fields via deep philosophical discourse to draw practical connections even if they’re not related to your major. Serving and having real life applications are big themes.\n\n**Harvard:**\n\nInfo Session: So, I actually really enjoyed the student panel at Brown (obviously I’d take a tour over a student panel, but it was still really helpful). Harvard was the only college to offer a student panel during the actual admissions info session (JHU had one student, but she didn’t talk much, while Harvard had 2 and the AO constantly asked them to talk about their experiences with X or Y). There’s 17 freshman houses, but they all eat at Annenberg hall (the Hogwarts looking thing). Then there’s 12 houses for all your other years, each with their own dining halls. 7:1 student to faculty, avg class size of 12 (though my tour guide said the intro lectures can be like 600-800, but they always split large lectures into sections of <30). You apply to the university and declare your major after 1.5 years. They really pride themselves on offering a liberal arts education and requiring students to take classes in a bunch of areas to be well rounded and knowledgeable about the world around them. So for application purposes, they want you to have interests and strong points in your profile, but not have ALL your ECs/interests be in CS or something. They have $7M in undergrad research funding annually, and there’s more research opportunities than students. They LOVE that phrase - 3 separate people quipped it to me when I asked them about research (felt kinda cultish lowkey). They also really loved to present Harvard as “choose your own adventure” - they said they don’t expect you to know what you’re going to do for sure (one of the guys on the student panel went in as a CS major and is now a senior in anthropology). They want you to explore things you’ve never done and keep doing them for the community you find. Oh, and they’re REALLY big on people, diversity, etc. - they kept saying the people make Harvard, that everyone is very different here which creates an interesting and connected community. So I guess if you and someone else have the same stats and similar ECs, don’t expect to both get in. Alumni interviews are offered on availability, but are highly recommended.\n\nSurrounding Area: Boston is BIG (as in, it took me an hour and a half to get from the Boston suburbs to Harvard). Cambridge is definitely a city. Maybe not compared to Boston, but definitely compared to the suburbs. Not really any row houses, mainly apartments, but they looked bigger than the ones in NYC. The streets were nice - not pristine, but much nicer than NYC/Philly. Not having homeless people follow you for 2 blocks also helps (true story). I think it’s right in the middle - if you’re from the city it won’t feel like being in the middle of nowhere, and if you’re from the suburbs or a rural area it shouldn’t be too overwhelming. Also, I just gotta shout out the gelato place at Harvard. They make rose shaped (!) gelato (!!) and you can pick as many flavors as you want (!!!) and each flavor becomes a rose petal (!!!!). I didn’t know about the multiple flavor thing until it was too late, but even with one flavor it was really good. The actual gelato was amazing too (I got pistachio). AND you get a free ice cream macaron. Not really free, just included in the price, but it was a nice surprise. The $13 bill was not.\n\nCampus Tour: It was the closest you can get to being an isolated bubble without actually being an isolated bubble. There were a few streets that ran through it, but for the most part there were huge pockets of Harvard-ness. Just a bit of the city was integrated - enough to have food places nearby, but not enough to feel like you’re not on a college campus. Also, the new SEAS campus is in Boston (a 40min walk/15min drive) from the main campus with the old SEAS buildings, so if you’re in engineering/cs/applied math you’ll have to shuttle back and forth a lot, which is kinda a downside. Other than that it was a pretty moderate campus in every other way - I really can’t see someone hating all 100% of it.\n\nKey Takeaways: You can literally drown in research here, THE GELATO IS TO DIE FOR, really great middle zone of city without as much bustle and campus integration into the city.\n\n**Johns Hopkins:**\n\nInfo Session: Got there like 15 mins early, a general video played that showed all the students having fun at different events. An AO gave the info session (not my regional AO sadly). Speech was very rehearsed but touched on everything you’d expect. Key things: 6:1 student to faculty ratio; 60% of students are from EDI/EDII pools; 85% of students do research/internships; 85% acceptance to med school (woo!) and 97% to law school. AO heavily emphasized the school mission - something about creating knowledge for the world. As someone who is gonna go into academia, this was super inspiring and really made me feel like the mission aligned with my ideas. They care about creating knowledge (if you wanna make a startup or go into research or have done this already), and sharing it by bettering your community (if you’ve had an impact in your community already). Also they offer lots of advising - general academic advising, specific advising for your major(s) and minor(s), career advising, etc. They emphasized that they don’t want you to have your life mapped out and know what your end goal is and exactly how you’re gonna get there - they just want you to know what you’re passionate about and what you want to do in the world, and have an idea about the paths you could take while being open to multiple paths/opportunities.\n\nSurrounding Area: Directly surrounding area looks kinda dangerous and run down, ngl. I live in suburbia so it may just be any big town that looks like that, but this isn’t the kinda place where I would feel 100% comfortable all the time. Lots of row houses (again - suburbia - we don’t have these! They look nice and quaint). The area around the hotel I stayed at (15 min drive away) was actually VERY nice - lots of people out and about, no graffiti, bunch of kids and adults playing soccer, basketball, tennis, etc. outside, definitely a place I would want to live in. \n\nCampus Tour: Actual campus was very nice and safe, didn’t look too old/run down and had some modern touches. Nice and spacious, with lots of quads. Definitely a traditional college campus - was very isolated from Baltimore and looked nothing like outside campus, like a little Hopkins bubble. They have a very neat gym/rec center. We went into one of the (lab?) buildings and there were a bunch of research posters on the walls. I read a few - looks like it’s pretty common for students to collaborate with profs here and at other unis. Student giving the tour spoke about how it was pretty easy to get research opportunities through good ole cold emailing and how profs were receptive to working with students (yayy). Also lots of talk about the collaborative environment - a parent asked about how competitive JHU was and like 3 students said everyone here helps each other. They genuinely seemed very nice - slightly introverted people who can yap for days.\n\nKey Takeaways: Hopkins be hopkinsing with that med school acceptance rate, huge emphasis on research and doing stuff for others (community), huge emphasis & resources for undergrad research, Baltimore isn’t as dangerous as everyone seems to say (maybe it is in some areas, but definitely not all).\n\n**MIT:**\n\nInfo Session: This has gotta be my favorite one by far (followed by Princeton and Yale in case anyone was wondering). This guy didn’t take questions, but if he did, I would have asked him about his public speaking skills, cause DAMN. Guy knew how to give a presentation. He was funny and amicable from the beginning. At the beginning when he was asking where everyone was from, what portion of the room was applicants/parents/counselors, etc. (stuff most AOs did), he asked if there were any alumni in the room. One girl raised her hand, and he said, “welcome home.” At MIT, they foster innovation and hands-on experience, and really revel in the whole nerdy scientist/engineer community. Their undergrad research opportunity program is the primary source of internships (in other schools they have similar programs, but most people get theirs through cold emailing). They do require you to take 8 humanities classes and 4 PE classes. 1st semester is Pass/No Record, and 2nd semester is A/B/C/No Record (so you can’t fail for the first year). REALLY INTERESTING STATS NO OTHER SCHOOL GAVE: upon graduation, 52% join the workforce (average starting salary of $115,461) and 43% go on to grad school. You apply to MIT, not to a major - in fact, 70-75% of applicants indicate interest in CS when applying, so you know most people don’t stick with their intentions. All undergrads take a similar set of 1st year courses, after which they declare their major. The AO then talked a bit about the separate application portal and how they use it because they’re looking for a specific set of students and the common app doesn’t help them find those. That’s why they don’t ask for a personal statement (but rather short essay responses), only have 4 activity slots, etc. He says they want to know why you think MIT is the best (what resources you’d use, professors, etc.) in your reason for applying, rather than just stating it’s the best. Interviews are assigned at random, but the tips he gave for the interview were to do your research on MIT, what professors you’d want to intern under, what programs you’d do, etc. and to bring a brag sheet/resume to either give to your interviewer if they ask, or to look at if your mind goes blank.\n\nSurrounding Area: See Harvard part for stuff on the city of Cambridge. The part of Cambridge that MIT is in is nicer than the part Harvard is in (sorry). Harvard’s area is nice and all, decently clean and without much (or any) trash in the streets. MIT area of Cambridge is PRISTINE. Like it literally could not be more clean and neat. MIT also has “MIT bubbles” like Harvard (see Harvard part), but it’s a bit more integrated into the city than Harvard. There were buildings for a bunch of big firms right near MIT’s campus. I walked into some research center that had a display on the 1st floor that was open to the public (because the topic of the research interests me) and walked out with the contact of one of the researchers there and a tentative virtual internship offer. So when they say MIT has insane research opportunities, it’s also the surrounding area.\n\nCampus Tour: Everything has a VERY modern look. There are no castle-like buildings, just concrete, glass, etc. Some of the buildings are older and some are newer, but none give medieval vibes like some other schools. Campus was also very very neat and pristine and clean. Not that much grass/quads though. I also gotta say, MIT must be on something because my MIT tour guide was also the best tour guide of any tour. He spoke about the MIT experience and campus life through stories and anecdotes, and was a really good storyteller. Some were his personal stories, some were MIT classics like the police car hack. It was an interesting way to approach a tour, since most tour guides just rattle off info and maybe a bit of their experience. This guy told stories, which I think explained the MIT vibe better than anything else could have.\n\nKey Takeaways: An absolute haven for nerdy engineers or stem people, every bit the stem community they market it as. The people are creative, innovative, their eyes sparkle when they talk about MIT. Campus and area are absolutely impeccable. This is kind of obvious, but research (and opportunities) are top tier.\n\n**Princeton:**\n\nInfo Session: A director of something admissions related (?) gave the info session. Confident and a really great speaker - not a rehearsed speech, and not an awkward one either. Just the right balance of jokes and passion to make you feel like it was a conversation rather than a presentation. Very undergrad focused school, ¾ of classes have 20 students or less, 5:1 student to faculty ratio, ALL classes taught by faculty, which includes 12 Nobel prize winners, some of whom even teach intro level classes. There’s a senior thesis req so everyone is required to do research, and most undergrads do research outside of that - profs are very open to working with students. Asked my tour guide about the ease of pubs, and he said it was pretty common for students to publish here. Cannot double major. 25% of the students are in engineering, the rest are in the regular arts & sciences program. You don’t apply to a major, just to a BSE or BA track (which you can then switch anytime before major declarations). Somewhere between Core and Open curriculums - you have to take courses within a certain focus area, but you get to pick which courses. Talked about the VERY strong alumni network a lot. 84% med school acceptance rate (lost by 1% to Hopkins lol), and 75% of undergrads eventually go on to higher education. They focus a lot on community and service and how you’ll contribute there. Also have a graded written paper req when you apply. At the Q&A portion, this girl had NO shame (I could never) and threw all these questions at the AO - about the eating clubs, how Princeton was handling political protests, etc. The AO answered the questions very gracefully and tactfully without actually answering them.\n\nSurrounding Area: SUBURBIA. Just like my old town back home… Honestly, it was really, really nice and safe and pretty. Lots of wild animals too, I saw a bunch of deer and foxes. Lots of houses, not many apartments or anything like that (though I assume they exist). Campus was somewhat of a bubble but it was big enough to still give the suburban feel, so it didn’t really feel like a bubble.\n\nCampus Tour: VERY big campus for a school that size, especially considering it has a set campus that’s separate from the city. But it’s still walkable and has shuttles that run back and forth. Expect lots of walking though - I’m a fan of long walks, so this isn’t an issue for me. Campus was very nice and clean, and had a lot of research peeps buzzing around. The labs were all open, and I got to trespass inside (shh) to check them out. Honestly, this is every researcher’s dream. There is SO much equipment, so many different labs, so many people… I will note that they use chalkboards, not whiteboards, which is a bit weird but to each their own. They’re also working on building a new Engineering building, which is HUGE and looks great.\n\nKey Takeaways: Suburban, small and undergrad focused, RESEARCH, sprawling campus with a nice, calm vibe.\n\n**UPenn:**\n\nInfo Session: The AO who gave this session was a more soft spoken man. Definitely didn’t feel as rehearsed. Even though there’s 10,000 students, most classes are taught by faculty and large lecture hall classes are rare. They were the only school that focused a lot on their founder (Ben Franklin), so taking a grateful and humble approach to the application will probably be an extra plus here. Said Ben Franklin embodied the school - interdisciplinary and exploring different fields & being an inventor/innovator in society by being the first to do something. They’re also really big on community - some classes incorporate community service projects, and they have lots of support systems for minorities. You can take classes at the graduate schools as an undergrad. They didn’t really have a “key thing we’re looking for in your app” - just the generic stuff. Interview is not considered in the admissions process and is purely for the applicant to get to know more about UPenn. I talked to a few students who had done research after the session - they all said getting research was super easy and the professors were very eager to work with students (9 in 10 profs had ongoing research), and that getting research even as a freshman was easy. Pubs are doable if you put in the effort.\n\nSurrounding Area: Again, this may just be me not being used to the city vibe, but there was lots of trash on the streets. A bunch of crumbling buildings and row houses, except instead of looking quaint like in the area of Baltimore I was in, they just looked run down. What I did like was that everything was kind of within the same area, from Penn Medicine and a few hospitals to the different graduate schools to the undergrad schools.\n\nCampus Tour: The campus is integrated into the city. It’s not one space for all the buildings like Hopkins. Also, each undergrad school has its own building (though you can take classes across any of the schools). The buildings aren’t in one isolated UPenn bubble - they’re within one area, but in the middle of Philly, with streets and stores between them. There are areas to the campus that feel less like a city - there’s a walkway with a bunch of trees, and in some locations you can barely tell you’re in a big city with a bustling street a short walk away. If you’re looking for something with a mix of big city vibes and nature feels, and don’t mind a campus that’s a bit integrated into the city, this campus might be right for you. I only got to go into Wharton, but I roamed around a bit - they only have group study rooms, but you can just go inside one alone which kinda defeats the purpose. The rooms are very nice, and so are the classrooms - everything looks clean and new. They have whiteboards.\n\nKey Takeaways: Definitely embraces the city instead of isolating the campus from it (cough cough Hopkins). Still manages to incorporate some nature. Great undergrad research opportunities. Don’t seem to want a specific “type” of student over others, aside from the things mentioned in the info session section (which are pretty basic things any college looks for).\n\n**Yale:**\n\nInfo Session: WAS HELD BY MY REGIONAL AO!!! As someone from an obscure area, I was sooo excited. He was really open about the admissions process, and truly believed fully in holistic admissions, inclusion, diversity, looking at context, etc. He seemed so genuine when he talked about it, and emphasized all these things A LOT. Said he has 2 questions he asks for admitting each student: How is the student going to contribute to Yale’s community? And: How is the student going to make use of Yale’s resources? Basically, he’s looking for how you’ve used resources in the past to grow, and what you’ve done in your community. He said, “Yale is not only a place of transformation, but a place to become what you’ve always been.” He looks for students who will transform in Yale in some way by using the resources, but also those who will use the resources to do what they’ve always wanted to do. For example, he mentioned how he’d always been afraid of public speaking, but at Yale he realized he’d always been a storyteller and started doing improv. They’re also really big on curiosity, spark, and passion - your unique story. You apply to the uni as a whole, not a major/college. Interviews are only if they want more info (all about that context/holistic admissions) - tons of people get admitted with and without them. And they’re looking for anecdotes specifically in the LOR. My tour guide actually talked more about Yale specifically than the AO (who only talked about financial aid and admissions - typically they talk about the school too). You can take up to 2 years to declare your major (but you can do it earlier). Yale is between Core and Open (like JHU and Princeton) - you have to take courses with a certain theme, but can pick which course you want to take that fits that theme. They have combined majors because double majoring is an option but hard - so instead of getting a major in math and a major in cs, you can get a single major in “math and cs.” There’s a 6:1 student to faculty ratio, with not many large lectures. Lectures are always professor led, but for larger lectures you might also have a TA for discussion groups (prof always has office hours tho).\n\nSurrounding Area: It was somewhat of a city (not suburbs like Princeton), but not as big/bustling as Philly, Baltimore, NYC, Boston, etc. Bigger than my city back home, and it definitely had a city feel, but not really a bustling feel. There were lots of these houses that were kinda like row houses, but with a tiny bit of spacing between them instead of being all smooshed together. \n\nCampus Tour: My tour guide had SUCH a competitive gunner personality, and was just such an ambitious, determined, knowing-where-you’re-headed leader. We also share the same first name, and honestly, that is who I aspire to be. Unlike Princeton/JHU, the campus was not a separate bubble. Roads did run through it. There was a whole road lined with STEM buildings (science hill?). Everything was very integrated though (unlike Columbia, where the engineering building was separate). Still, the campus was pretty nice. It had a lot of the old fashioned castle vibe, but everything was super neat (lawns, pathways, etc.) and I really liked the layout. \n\nKey Takeaways: Really nice Goldilocks town and school, truly values holistic process and background/context (maybe that’s just my AO tho). Cares a lot about diversity - of everything, socioeconomics included (they spent so much of the presentation on financial aid - longer than any other school). Lots of places say these things, but here at Yale it felt most genuine."

    "body": "\n*this is mostly in regards to elite institutions/T25s\n\nEdit 2: read edit two \n\nOg post: \nI’ve lurked here for 4 years. I applied to 20 colleges, wrote 43 pages of final essay drafts, and each school went through 15+ pages of revisions and drafts. For every hour I spent writing, I probably spent 3–4 hours scrolling this sub, r/collegeresults, other forums, and school-specific pages.\n\nBottom line: I’ve studied thousands of profiles. I’ve seen trends with who gets in and who doesn’t. This is not scientific. It’s not calculated. It’s just what I’ve observed. \n\n———\n\nThe paradox of college admissions\n\nThe biggest trap is the paradox of being genuine.\n\nHow can you “do what you’re passionate about” when you only have time to do activities as a resume builder?\n\nHow can you write passionately about something you don’t care about?\n\nHow can you write interestingly about the small things you actually do care about, when they feel irrelevant?\n\nHOW CAN YOU SHOW A COLLEGE YOU ARE GENUINELY INTERESTING AND PASSIONATE ABOUT THE LIFE YOU LIVE?\n\nThis is the question everyone is secretly trying to answer.\n\nAnd I don’t know the answer. But I have different things to think about. \n\n⸻\n\nWhy your 1550 SAT and perfect ECs aren’t enough\n\nHere’s the rundown. At the top level (or whatever tier you’re aiming for, assuming you have realistic expectations — don’t apply to Harvard with an 1100), everyone has similar stats. SAT, GPA, APs, awards, sports. Sorry, but (academically) you’re basically clones with minor differences.\n\nThe only things that set you apart are your activities and your writing. And I don’t mean the activities section of the Common App (we are all pretty similar with that too). I mean the stuff you don’t even think to list: eating your grandma’s cookies, fishing with the boys, forging metal, building weird-ass paper airplanes, watching JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, talking about Star Wars with your dad’s second cousin’s best friend’s mom. Fortnite. That is your life. \n\nBlunt truth: about 70% of people on r/collegeresults with 1550+ SATs who didn’t get in anywhere “good” are boring as fuck. Super smart? Sure. Analytical? Fine. But lifeless. These are the people who go to Dartmouth’s admitted students day and take pictures of squirrels and trees because they’ve never seen them. (Real story. Go outside, guys. Please.)\n\nMeanwhile, the ones who get in — even with lower SATs (again, in regards to elite college admissions), like 1450+ — are always writing with more joy, creativity, and energy (at least from my perspective). The people I’ve met at Yale with “lower” scores have told some of the best stories I’ve ever heard. Their conversational style (and thus their writing) was entertaining and human.\n\n⸻\n\nColleges want humans, not resumes on legs\n\nColleges need variety in their communities. At the top you have to be smart and interesting. Yes, they need some supergeniuses. And no, that’s not you. You’d know if it was, because you would’ve known since third grade, and you wouldn’t be on this subreddit in the first place. \n\nDo not rely on academics. Everyone’s been to the science convention. Everyone’s cracked at instruments. Everyone has 9000 volunteer hours.\n\nYour “resume builders” aren’t cool. They aren’t special. What’s special is that you did all that while also learning pottery, lifeguarding with your buddies, building a treehouse for your brother, or becoming a typing-race warrior at 2 a.m. That’s human. That’s dedication and determination to create a life worth living. That’s real. \n\nAnd here’s the thing: humanity and being real add way more value to a college community than being able to solve calculus  problems 5% faster than Johnny. Johnny forages mushrooms on weekends, and still has 95% of your calc skill. Johnny has a cooler life than you. \n\n*the exception here is if you genuinely love math or something or any other academic, in which case you will be able to talk passionately about it. (Like I’m saying you love math for the math, like Johnny loves mushrooms. And I just know someone is going to be like “bUt i LoVe mATh” but has never done it outside of school)\n\n⸻\n\nThe bottom line\n\nStay human. You are advocating to humans on a selection board. Make yourself interestingly passionate about the little things, because those are what ground you. Those are what keep you real. This cannot be faked, so do not try to fake it. If it’s not working, write about something else. Colleges have been figuring this shit out for hundreds of years, they know if you care or not about something.\n\nColleges are not looking for perfect machines coming in with nothing more than inflated resumes. They are looking for thoughtful, motivated students who bring something alive and human to the campus.\n\nIf you take nothing else from this, take this: stop asking about SAT and GPA and other basic stats for the Ivy League. Everyone has that and you aren’t going to get any different answers.\n\nStart asking people if your writing comes across as intelligent, genuine, and real, whether the prompt asks about your life or your academics. Because if your essays make you sound like a machine, you will lose to Johnny the mushroom guy every single time.\n\nTdlr:  At the top schools everyone is smart, so what separates admits from rejects is not numbers but whether you can prove you are a real, alive, and interesting human being worth adding to a community.\n\n\nEdit: Holy wow some of you guys are dumb and salty as some rocks.\n\nMy point was that when applicants all have similar top level academics, the way to differentiate yourself isn’t with more academics, but rather with more interesting things about the life you’ve led. \n\nIt’s an obvious point made many times, restated by me\n\nTHESE ARE MY THOUGHTS, I literally said that in the 6th sentence.\n\nSo grow up you bums\n\nEdit 2: \n\nIn case you morons can’t understand this post, here’s another try:\n\nIt’s not about being more interesting than someone else. It’s not saying academics aren’t important. It’s simply about advocating about what makes you, you. \n\nSpecifically, advocating to an AO who may appreciate bringing your personality and presence to their campus. \n\nIM NOT SAYING ACADEMICS ARE IRRELEVANT IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER\n\n\n\n Edit 3:\n\nThe point stands for all levels of colleges. If you have average academics, then you will want to stand out from the other students with average academics. \n\nEdit 4:\n\nBe smart, be interesting. "

    "body": "Hey everybody. I'm 23M, and I graduated last year. I was in a frat, and I was very popular. I had leadership positions within Greek life and the house I was in specifically. My resume found great success, but I'm hear to say that - despite what your parents have said about their greek life experiences, despite what those energetic friends of yours are saying about greek life, despite what you see on barstool sports, and despite my opening couple of sentences - **please, please,** ***please*** **don't rush your freshman year if you can help it at all**. Honestly, whatever floats your boat, but if you're not the type to drink all the time, give zero shits about classes (and, by proxy, your future), or generally not care greatly about yourself and your life - please reconsider rushing, period.\n\nI rushed because my dad pushed me to do so. He was in a frat, and is obsessed with his time in college, even now, over 40 years later. I never understood the draw, but I figured that if my literal father figure had such positive experiences, it couldn't hurt me either.\n\nIt did. It did badly, and in unseen ways. I didn't take the time to learn myself first, and spend some uncomfortable time alone in college, getting to know myself and my interests. Instead, I jumped headfirst into a centuries-old culture of abuse and strict hierarchy (both formally and socially), thinking it would be different because my frat said that they were 'not like the rest', and to their credit, for a bit they weren't. Then the school year started. To give you a quick rundown:\n\n\\- For the first semester, I effectively had another full-time class: the frat. Yes, they assigned homework, and we had mandatory meetings each week, with drills after each meeting to see what we knew. I say drills and laugh, because here's what it actually was: all of us (new members, not yet initiated mind you) on our feet in the dark basement in front of a fireplace, screaming at the top of our lungs the information we were expected to know. Our frat wasn't as abusive as others on campus, but if you got something wrong, you stood in front of the fire, and for each time thereafter you got something wrong, you took a step closer to the fire. One guy's pants started smoking, just from having to stand in front of the flames (which were constantly made larger). This was once a week, for the entire first semester of college (oh, and you're in a suit for this too. You'll see the pledges on campus - khakis, white shirt, blue jacket, red tie, and complete exhaustion in their eyes).\n\n\\- After initiation, nothing changes. You're not special, and in fact, people are less interested in you, because you're not someone who can be bullied as easily anymore. However, bullying and harassment are still rampant. Get ready to keep your porcupine quills up the whole time you're there, because if there's one thing that a group of toxic, insecure people are always looking for, it's the next downward punching bag. Oh, but if you defend the person getting bullied, you get sucked into the fold, too. I mentioned I was popular - I used this 'soft power' to step in and defend as many people as I could, but something else about frats - if the bullying gets exposed, they just get better at hiding it. It's an absolutely brutal and immature loop that honestly only gets more complicated as the years of college go on. It's not a game you can win unless you physically throw down (which everyone wants to do already) or leave.\n\n\\- There is no academic support, there is no alumni network, there are no job perks after college. I don't give a shit what the promo stuff they give you says. Those are for the guys who rush at frats where their daddies are big contributors, and almost only for those guys. If you find something, it's blind luck. Also, even if there are alumni looking to hire - ask yourself if they're really people you want to work for and with. Are they actually different from the people you so despise now, or are they just older versions of those guys? (I'll tell you right now, 9/10 times it's the latter). The houses say they have study hours and study times - try getting work done. I dare you. For several months, I literally spent more hours in the library on campus than I did almost anywhere else. Maybe that's typical. But is it such a crime to want to work peacefully at the place you reside? The alumni network consisted of whoever the fuck showed up on gamedays, and they were always piss hammered anyways, so it didn't matter what you said to them. They weren't going to remember you.\n\n\\- The culture is drinking. That's it. That's literally it. I want to elaborate, but doing so would only dilute this point. I abstained from drinking for the sake of self-improvement after my first semester freshman year, and found myself almost immediately devoid of any relatable group of people. It was really weird, actually. People treated me like I had a problem because I *didn't* drink like a fish.\n\nNow, these are the biggest four. I could go on for ages, but that's to be saved for my therapist. I'll also say that, yes. I chose to do this. Yes, I chose to pay $900 a semester and $500+ a month for rent, just to be miserable. Yes, I could have gotten out! But then do what? I'd have to find housing and the money to pay for it, for one - while paying for the frat, because you're locked into year long lease contracts at the house if you want to (or can) live there.\n\nHow did it hurt me in unseen ways, you ask? It's a hard one to articulate, but it definitely has to do with not feeling fit in at all for four years without feeling like there was any out, while having a full courseload, while working weekends and any spare time at all to support yourself (I had to pay dues and most of rent myself), so no time to socialize in the only way the only people around you seem to know how. I've spent this past year debriefing/reeling/trying to process my college experience and figure out who the fuck I actually am because I didn't get that chance (or, rather, give myself that chance) in college.\n\nNow, I want to be very clear. It's very easy for the older ones of us to look back at this life and be like 'well, duh. of course a frat is going to be that way.' how do you know that? how *did* you know that? how would those who don't or didn't have positive role models, or any at all, know that, before going to college? And before I hear 'just look it up online', politics has shown us that that just doesn't fucking work.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for the read. If you're on your way to college, think twice about rushing. If you've already rushed, don't beat yourself up, but still do some thinking about where you are, who you are, where you want to go, and who you want to be, and if the organization you've joined will actually help you get there, or only create more swamp to trudge through in pursuit of your goals.\n\nedit:\n\n\"*- if the bullying gets exposed, they just get better at hiding it.*\"\n\nthis is why frat rituals/the frat itself is/are so secretive. You don't talk publicly about things you're embarassed to be doing.\n\nedit 2:\n\n\"*Yes, I chose to pay $900 a semester and $500+ a month for rent, just to be miserable.\"*\n\nThis was the cheapest option on my campus at the time. There were scant financial support opportunities on my campus for those who were financially insecure. I ask for your consideration - what would they do? \n\nEDIT 3 - AND THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT: \n\nI forgot to talk about the rampant - R A M P A N T - homophobia in Greek Life. Like it's actually insane. Speaking for frats specifically here, everyone has such an inflated ego that everyone thinks that everyone is hitting on them - including the dudes - and because these are the ultra-dude-bro type, no homo was the name of the game. To the Nth power. We had a couple of openly gay guys in the house when I first got there, which was cool. Everyone was too afraid to talk to them because they were too afraid of being perceived as gay. They all dropped in-mass when they realized how much the guys in the house fucking hated gay people. This was because those guys stopped hiding it, and the rest of the house didn't care enough to stand up for them (I was only one person, mind you, in the face of 100+). I really can't say that their safety was ensured, but thank God they never stayed at the house for long enough to find out. If you're unsure as to your sexuality, there's nothing wrong with that - just please be really, really careful around frats. With centuries-old institutions comes centuries-old customs...and opinions. "

Other kids kept telling me it’s okay and that what she’s doing is unnecessary, and now I’m hiding in a bathroom stall.\nShe said I did a good job; but than continued to pick apart my presentation, saying I was in “right direction.” I don’t know what to do I feel like I can’t breathe.\n\nNote: A few things I messed up when writing this. Firstly, I made it look like I ran out of the classroom while class was still in session. No, I did end up sitting throughout all of it, waiting til class ended. Additionally, I did not mean to make it sound like criticism is a bad thing. I am going to school to be a teacher, of course criticism is a valued thing. However, I do believe that singling me out at the end of class, looking at me specifically, saying my name, and telling me personally that I did not do as well as I should have was uncalled for. I am a firm believer in 1:1 conversation, or of course the traditional rubric.\n\nSo after class, my phone was going off with people from class telling me that they were sorry \nfor me, asking me if I was okay, and telling me they were scared to present. I didn't really get back to people as for some reason I thought the best place was Reddit (thank you to the people who gave me valuable insight.) As I was finally calming down, I recieved an email from the professor asking me to meet with them in their office hours.\nSo I went, and it turns out that the professor did not even fail me. This project involved an essay, which I did do the extra credit, and used additional sources. However, my problem is still that she called me \"emotional\" over being upset over the fact that I pointed out that I was the only student that she in great detail critiqued publically, even though the other two presenters that day did something similarly. Additionally, she claimed that since not many students signed up to present today that she felt like it would be a good time to give feedback. I respectfully expressed that although I understand she may have meant well, exclusively doing this to me made me feel singled out. I am a first semester student in a class with juniors and seniors, literally the kid next to me is graduating when this semester ends, and was the main one telling me that her live criticism was unnecessary.\n\nI just did want to say that in regards to me being a softy, dramatic, yada yada-- yes, I do have a diagnosed anxiety disorder, yes I take medications, and yes, to the person who DM'd me asking about a previous post I made about my still recent-ish traumatic experience at campus, I am in a very delicate space. I am a published author, I went to an art school-- I understand the value of criticism, and embrace it. However, the criticism on top of my classmates repeadetly asking me if I am okay made me emotional and felt vulnerable. I have never felt so embarrased in my entire life. \n\nBut now lowkey, I am going to be taking everyones mutual advice, as I do have her next semester I will be attending office hours and doing my best to follow her criteria word for word. I know this presentation does not defy my academic journey, but it is important to me to do well.  \n\nUPDATE: I ended up getting the only 100% on the presentation, and got out of the class with an A.

    "body": "Hello All,\n\nI’m a recent grad and realized that August is quickly approaching and that many of you on here are looking for advice on how to succeed in college. I’m here to offer you the only advice you will truly need to balance social life and academic life. \n\nThis post is most directed towards freshmen, but I didn’t figure it out until my sophomore year, so everyone else welcome. \n\nI say this as a graduate of a university, who ended with a 3.87, worked 20+ hours a week during the school year, was involved in multiple clubs, and made some very close friends who I am still in contact with.\n\nDo not overthink this.\nDo exactly what your professors tell you to do, and then go have fun.\n\nWhat I mean by this:\nYour classes are going to be structured as a series of lectures, homework assignments, projects, tests, readings, optional readings, and extra worksheets.\nA minority of this stuff will actually be graded. Your professors will probably give you a couple assignments to do, and then your readings, worksheets, notes etc. will not be graded.\n\nHear me when I say this. \nDO EVERYTHING YOUR PROFESSOR TELLS YOU TO DO\n\nThey’ve been teaching this class for far longer than you’ve been in college. They know whats needed for you to pass the class. READ EVERY READING, DO EVERY UGRADED ASSIGNMENT.\n\nDo not skim, do not use AI summaries and cheat sheets. Just do the work.\n\nThis also includes that if they say that you should go to office hours, then you should go. A lot of times they will deadass give you the answers to the exam in office hours.\n\nAnything that your prof says you should do: do it. And then as soon as you’re done, go out, go party.\n\nYou’re going to meet a lot of people that skim thru the assignments, don’t do the extra work, and then end up cramming later on. \n\nThe secret is, if you just do exactly what your prof tells you to do, you will be fully prepared for every test and spend less time in total studying than the kids cramming or doing extra work until 4am.\n\nThen as soon as you’re done. Go out. You finish you’re work at 5pm? Go get food with your friends, go to an event, go to the gym, get a job, do something.\n\nDo not spend time worrying if you’re ready for your next test, bc if you did everything your professor told you to, then you’re fine.   \n\nIf you’re the kind of person that wants to go to parties but is a lighter/less experienced drinker. Do not drink a lot, drink as little as possible.\n\nWhat you want to think about is your average recovery time. So the more drugs/drinking you do the longer your recovery time is into your school work the next day. If you’re going out on a Thursday, you want to be ready for your classes the next day. \n\nI cannot understate how much an edge you will have on your classmates if you just generally stay soberish (and hydrated), and do all the work your professors tell you to do.\n\nIf you’re not getting slowed down by drinking and drugs and you’re doing all your work, you’re deadass unstoppable. \n\nSpeaking from personal experience, using this model you can be going out like 4 times a week, passing all your classes, chilling.\n\nPeople take things too far a lot in college, and moderation is learned. But don’t overthink this shit. It’s gonna be fine.\n\n(And maybe do something else besides party with your time too, clubs, sports, jobs, etc are all super cool experiences to have on campus, and if you follow the model you will have plenty of time to do it all)\n\nA last word of encouragement: friends take time and effort to make. Try to be friendly with everyone you meet, get people’s numbers, invite people out to lunch, it’s only weird if you make it weird.\n\nBest of luck to everyone, hope this helps\n\nEdit*\nCollege is of course a part of regular life, and most of us end up experiencing financial, family, housing, etc problems. This model means that when times get tough, you stop going to parties, you prioritize your job, etc. But you ALWAYS make sure you do exactly as your professor advises. You can make it through basically any crisis with your degree intact if you just do all of the work.\n\nEdit* \nA lot of times profs wont explicitly tell you what to do during the lectures. Don’t be afraid. READ THE SYLLABUS, SYLLABUS IS BIBLE\nIt’s probably all written in there, or on your digital learning platform, etc. trust me it’s written somewhere, or they’ll tell u.\n\nI’m sure this seems a bit obvious but you would be surprised how long it takes to get the hang of. You can waste so much time worrying ab your grades and not having fun, or you can j get your shit done and then go out."

I thought I'd get some tips from this sub. Instead, I felt worry, stress and despair.\n\nWho the heck are you people?  Seriously? How do you have perfect SAT / ACT Scores? How are you in all AP classes with scores of 5? How are you published authors who started foundations? And, on top of that, you are national champions in an obscure but amazing sport. You are accomplished musicians and fluent in four languages. You are President of your student body and you have a patent.\n\nI was certain that my kid would never be accepted to any college anywhere after learning about the accomplishments of others.. My kid is amazing. But my kid is human. Folks on this sub are just next level.\n\nSo, my kid, despite not having a resume like others on this sub was accepted to, and attended a selective and prestigious private university with a single digit acceptance rate.  It's an amazing uni no doubt. But after attending it's not what my kid wanted. They started transfer applications the beginning of second semester.\n\nI skipped the part about not being accepted to the dream school, a private uni that was highly selective, but we thought was within reach. It was rough. The sun rose the next day, and life continued\n\nMy kid wanted more diversity and a larger school, so after a year, they transferred. They are now at a state school that is selective, but far less so than the private school. My kid is happy in this campus with so much diversity. They did a lot of volunteer political work and had an amazing internship over the summer.\n\nI wish everyone the best. But please know - parents and students that being in a selective university does not necessarily mean success. Not being accepted does not mean failure.  Enjoy the process, take time to read for pleasure, find extracurriculars for fulfillment and not to build a resume.\n\nMany on this sub will go on to higher education. So, we can fret about that too. But people who are truly smart and gifted can find ways to learn.\n\nI spent so much time stressed. It was time wasted. Pet a dog, walk on grass, sing for fun, play a board game, hula hoop, make S'mores. Talk with someone face to face. Do something that makes you happy.  Hang in there!\n\nEdit: How did my kid get accepted to a super selective school? Honestly luck surely played a role. They are also a very good writer   Also, the \"top of the mountain\" wasn't as great as they imagined. A state school is much more fulfilling - for this student anyway. "

    "body": "Everyone frets over brand-name campuses, but the evidence says the test score you walk in with does more of the heavy lifting later on. Long-run tracking of top-scoring teens in the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth found that the higher a kid’s SAT, the more likely they were, decades later, to hold PhDs, patents and six-figure jobs, regardless of where they enrolled for college.  ￼\n\nEconomists Stacy Dale and Alan Krueger tried the ultimate apples-to-apples test: they compared students who got into the same mix of selective and less-selective schools and then chose differently. Once you equalize ability (their SATs, class rank, extracurriculars), the earnings gap from picking Duke over Ohio State vanishes for the typical student. In other words, a kid with a 1550 who picks OSU is likely to earn about the same as their equally scored friend at Duke. A newer, massive Texas study replicated this: any wage boost from attending a “more selective” campus fades to zero within a few years, while factors like instructional spending and STEM completion matter far more.  ￼\n\nCaveats: if you grow up low-income or Black/Hispanic, selective colleges do add a meaningful bump; networks and support services seem to pay off there. And if you’re chasing pedigreed pipelines (think hedge-fund analyst or Supreme Court clerk), elite campuses still open doors. But for the median middle-class kid aiming for a solid career, the score on the front end is simply a stronger statistical signal than the logo on the diploma.\n\nBottom line: build the skills that push your SAT/ACT into the right tail, pick a school you can afford that offers the major you want, and graduate. Prestige is nice icing; the cake is your underlying ability.\n\n**TL;DR:** There’s no need to stress too much about the admissions game. If you have the stats to get into a top-20 school but don’t get in due to bad luck, you’ll very likely do just as well later in life. Hope for the best, and know that the worst case isn’t so bad."

I found my path to medicine rather organically and non-traditionally. Found my purpose. Fell in love with it. Worked my ass off and got accepted. Now my mother will not attend my white coat ceremony. \nWhy? \nI honestly don’t know, but my suspicion is because of an argument I had with my older sister. I feel like she should not be involved in my interpersonal relationships with my siblings, but for some reason when I argue with this specific sister, my mother will immediately text me in my sister’s defense while tearing me down completely. In one of our last convos before I took the MCAT she told me I would make a horrible doctor. She told me this because my sister hung up the phone on me. I still don’t understand why she hung up the phone. She said my voice triggered her, whatever that means to her. I do not yell at people so I’m not sure what I did or said to cause that reaction. \n\nLast December I flew across the country to see and spend time with her on her birthday. Last minute, she canceled. She refused to see me the entire 5 days I was home. She also refused to let me spend time with my 13 year old sister. \n\nThis Mother’s Day, knowing she’d recently moved, I asked for her new address so I could send a gift. She gave me the address of one of my siblings, and her gift was accidentally given to my grandma (her ex-MIL) who was staying with my sister at the time. My mom is now angry that I will not send a duplicate gift. \n\nMy siblings who depend on her (there are many of us) also “cannot attend” the ceremony for whatever reasons they have, despite most flying across the country for another siblings’ undergrad graduation. Idk, it’s very cult-like the way my family works. Like an inner circle and an outer one. \n\nAnyway, this is getting long. And I am sad. But maybe it is for the best. She would find a way to make it about her. Or maybe I am sour-graping. Idk. \n\nEDIT: I just want to say thanks to all who commented offering support. I cried myself to sleep last night but it’s honestly the last time. I am not usually one to match petty energy and I still will not, but I think it is time to completely cut off the things my mother benefits from (that I pay for???) because she’s obviously forgotten. So the phone bill I’ve been paying for 10 years I will be cutting off. I placed her as an authorized user in my credit cards to boost her credit (she did not have the physical cards) but I think I will remove her. I don’t think it’s fair to continue to bash me while also benefiting from me. In 10 years I never threw that in her face and never would. With school being so expensive it’s only reasonable to cut expenses where possible. It’s something I worry about because she has some health issues, but I know that if anything serious were to happen, my siblings would call me. At least one of them would call. \n\nA few things to add:\n\nI have a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist I have been working with for a few years. They both agree that my mother’s behavior stems from a combination of jealousy that my education and life enjoyments will supersede hers, and also that the child she expected to do “great things” did not actually go on to do great things. \n\nI am aware that this behavior is not normal. It was hard, but over time I have been able to at least acknowledge, if not come to terms with, the reality that I grew up in a very toxic and competitive environment exacerbated by poverty among other things. It was quite cult like, and I did leave under cover of night several years ago because they kept breaking into my CAMPUS APARTMENT and stealing the tips I made working as a server. There is more, but not for the Reddit. \n\nI don’t want her to “come crawling back,” as many have suggested she would do after I am established as a physician. I do think reflection is needed, but she is a narc so it won’t happen. I know it’s bad, but she’s my mom. She’s the only mom I know, and I don’t wish anything bad. I just hope she heals. I hope she grows. And I hope she lets me see my youngest sister from time to time. Otherwise, I guess I’ll wait until she’s 18? \n\nThis is long again but thank you for reading. And thank you all who commented your support. "

You'll never know who I am.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, at 12:00 AM GMT (that's not my actual time zone), I got the most soul-crushing rejection letter from Harvard REA, but instead of wallowing in self-pity, I’ve decided to take a jab at the entire admissions process. I believe you don't have to get into a college to truly get into a college. We've all heard of that student who snuck into Harvard for a semester, who went by the name of Jane. I consider myself walking in her boots.\n\nSo Harvard isn't deciding my fate. *I* am. AOs, if you're reading this, *I'm* the admissions officer now. Why me? What experiences have you had that changed your perspective, and how does this effect me? Suck it.\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n*Perfect the Backstory*\n\nFirst off, my story has to be air-tight. I’ve already Googled every single thing about pre-orientation programs, dorms, class schedules, and even how to finesse my way into Annenberg for meals. By the time I’m on campus, I’ll know more about Harvard than some actual students. Since last week, I've memorized every single thing they serve and how to enter each of the buildings without an ID card. To say the least, you guys are cooked, just like the food I'll be munching on at Harvard.\n\n*Social Media*\n\nMy Instagram is about to scream “Class of 2028.” I’ve followed enough Harvard meme pages and Sidechat accounts to blend in seamlessly. My LinkedIn will make me look like a prodigy--just so you know, I'm a four-time ISEF qualifier, I made IMO freshmen year, I created four nationwide nonprofits and raised more money than your parents make in a year, combined, and met Biden.\n\n*The Fake Harvard ID*\n\nTwo words: Adobe Photoshop. “Jane” couldn’t produce one, and had to ask other people to enter buildings. Rookie mistake. I’ll have one that can pass any casual glance and a spare for backup.  \n\n*Finding My “In”*\n\nI’ll pose as a commuter student to explain why I’m not in a dorm. A super rare “family emergency” exception? Done. My photographic memory comes in handy when I'm memorizing Harvard's obscure commuter study spots and make friends with a proctor or two. It’s all about making people believe.\n\n*Master the Lingo*\n\nI've done my research, nerds. I know Harvard kids love saying niche things like “p-set” and “section kids.” The quizlet set has been mastered, and I got a 100% on the test for any niche terms so I don’t end up like that one person who says “freshman year” instead of “first year.”  \n\n*Integrating Into Classes*\n\nHere’s the kicker guys. I’ll audit classes. Easy ones to sneak into: big lectures like Ec10a or CS50. Professors won’t even notice. My ACADEMIC WEAPONRY will come in handy, not a single second of procrastination, and I’ll get those assignments in days early and sit in study groups to solidify my presence.  \n\n*Dodging the Directory*\n\nIf anyone asks, I opted out for privacy reasons (FERPA, anyone?).  \n\n\n\nSo you just wait. By the time anyone suspects me, it’ll be too late. I’ll have Harvard kids tagging me in Instagram posts, inviting me to finals clubs, and asking for notes in Gen Ed classes. Also, this isn’t about disrespecting Harvard. It’s about beating the system and proving that rejection letters can’t define me. Will I probably get caught? Maybe. But until then, you can catch me at Annenberg—table by the stained glass window. I'll be one of those thousands of kids studying there. One hint, I'll give you one hint: >!Wow, you guys are gullible. You actually think I'm dumb enough to give you my physical attributes so you can find me? The fact that you read this deep into a reddit r/a2c shitpost is already bad enough. Get a life.!<\n\nAnyways, catch me in Cambridge, besties. If “Jane” can do it for a semester, I can go for at least a year. PEACE."

Your club can determine who your friends are, what connections you will make. Many of these clubs are hard to get into. According to a 2023 article by Rachel Shin in The Atlantic, the Voyager Consulting business club at the University of California, Berkeley, typically receives 800 to 1,000 applicants each semester and rejects all but six or seven. Shin, who is graduating this month from Yale, described a fellow student’s efforts to get into the Existential Threats Initiative, a club in which students gather to talk about climate change and artificial intelligence. The young woman got rejected because she didn’t have enough experience with existential threats. “We wanted to be more selective so we could have more advanced conversations,” the club founder told Shin. The selectivity system means it’s harder to try new things; you have to be an expert in something to even get in the door.\n\nHarvard freshmen go through something called comps, which is the competition to get into the school’s more than 400 student organizations. According to a 2017 story in The Harvard Crimson, the Crimson Key Society, which organizes campus tours and freshman orientation week, rejected 88.5 percent of the students who applied. \""

They are so disgustingly rich and have no idea what it’s like in the real world. Since I don’t own property, I lived with my parents before I came here, which factors into my student finance. I get the minimum loan, despite the fact we are not rich at all. My parents cannot afford to help me financially.

I also wasn’t educated for quite a long time as I went to an extremely violent pupil referral unit from the ages of 13-16 after I was expelled from school for standing up to a ‘pdf file’. They didn’t teach us GCSEs, and consequently, I didn’t finish my A-levels until I was 19 because I was playing catch-up for so long and COVID happened. I got terrible A levels and did a foundation year at a pretty bad university. I got a really high grade in that foundation year, and a very good reference from the head of the physics department, which I believe was what secured my place at my current university. Regardless, whenever I tell people about my life (because they asked), they turn their noses up at me. When people find out I didn’t do A-level maths or further maths, they tell me I’m going to fail my degree. My academic advisor even alluded to this himself. I can’t afford the campus gym, so I have to walk 3 miles up and down the absolute worst hill in order to go to the gym I can afford. I can’t afford the bus. Also, I have to do the same for food shopping, since I can’t afford the on-campus shops. The workload is ridiculous, and 100% of the course is exam-based. Formative assessments are mandatory, despite being worth 0% of the grade, and they assume you’ve done further maths here so they just expand on things I didn’t even learn in my foundation year.\n\nWhat the fuck am I doing with my life?

My mom attended, so I hoped legacy status would work in my favor (though I know it doesn’t carry as much weight anymore). I applied as an English major with a dance minor, since dance is a huge part of my life—I've trained at a high level for years, and I wanted to continue pursuing it in college. Vassar has a pretty good dance program, and I visited multiple times, falling in love with the campus, the library (seriously, it’s stunning), and the overall environment.\n\nI went the extra mile by connecting with the dance department—I even knew someone there already and took classes with them. The faculty were incredibly supportive, and they told me they would give me their highest recommendation to admissions, even saying they were confident I’d be accepted. I emailed back and forth with the department, with receipts of them confidently saying that they could not wait to work with me in the upcoming years. So, you can imagine my shock when mid-December came, and I was flat-out rejected. No waitlist. No deferral. Just… *no.*\n\nI was completely crushed. The rejection shattered my self-esteem because I truly believed I would be at Vassar next fall (rookie mistake, I know). Worse, I had slacked on my other applications since I was so convinced I wouldn’t need them. That left me scrambling to submit 20 schools in 4-5 weeks, which was brutal.\n\nI’m sharing this because this process is wildly subjective. It’s not always about who you are as a student or applicant. Admissions officers boil you down to a few minutes of review, and even with strong recommendations from a department, it’s no guarantee.\n\nRight now, I’m still waiting on my decisions, but I won’t lie—this process has really dampened my excitement for college. I felt that by applying ED1 to a school I was confident in, my future would be in *my* control. But the reality is, you can do everything \"right\" and still not get the outcome you want. And that’s okay.\n\nTo anyone going through this—whether you got deferred, rejected, or are just waiting anxiously—I feel you. This process is brutal, and I wouldn’t wish this stress on anyone.

My top four schools being NYU, Columbia, Villanova and UPenn. I also considered campus environment: i literally googled if there were party scenes at prestigious universities, if there were keeping up with the joneses cultures, and how pretty the libraries were. these were values i established right away before i looked at how their programs for my interests ranked in comparison. am i wrong in saying that this doesn’t seem common? “chance me for T20s/HYPSM.” Harvard is way different from Yale and then Princeton too? Stanford isn’t even on the same coast and MIT being the most standout? The one connecting factor between these all is just their rankings. \n\ni saved this problem for last because it makes my argument here look conceited:\n\ncollege admissions encourage people to be losers: they don’t value in any way a social life. i can’t depict the memories i’ve made at football games, dances, parties, getting crowned for royalty, or even just nights at target shopping or going to the mall. making solid connections is an accomplishment too. to be able to socialize, be personable, etc. is a skill that will get you far in life and yet college admissions processes take this into account none. now in no way am i saying this is the most important, but socialization and fraternization amongst youth is severely important, and those who can’t live socially likely will struggle in community-based environments. i understand that this is where extracurriculars should come in, but when kids are engaging in facetious extracurriculars to impress a college rather than that which attracts them most, they aren’t going to make lasting relationships because it’s not important to them there. objectively, the more facetious your extracurriculars are, the less likely you will be able to make relationships based on mutual interests, one because you don’t have mutual interests, and two because you do not care. this is no matter to the admissions process though. me personally, i find the salutation who balanced grades, sports, and a prominent social life over the valedictorian who spends his friday night writing a research paper that serves only to impress an admissions officer.\n\nnow onto who is to blame:\neveryone. likely you. definitely me at some point. especially colleges. and especially subreddits like this. the college admissions culture continues to perpetuate these narratives. even high schools cause kids to gain an over confidence because when you think you’re the best, you tend to be expecting the best. however, in every single case, there is no best university. there is no best applicant. the college application processed and all the students, parents, officers, counselors, and teachers who have encouraged you to become the “perfect applicant” by engaging in extracurriculars you don’t actually care about and throwing away your life for grades, a ranking, etc. have objectively failed you.\n\nwhat can you do to change:\ni am not trying to act like i’m perfect. three months ago i was the same kid who wanted to be that perfect applicant and only cares about going to Ivy League schools. but it took one person to snap me out of it: a random guy who i had been talking to for months but who had no similarities with me in terms of academics. this kid is attending our hometown school or CC next year for reference. but here’s what he asked me that snapped me out of the haze of prestige: “tell me more about the schools you’re applying to” and when I couldn’t tell\nhim about UChicago, Yale, MIT, JHU, etc., beyond excusing them for their rigor and taking, he asked me “why the fuck would [I] apply there?” however there were a few schools i could tell him about being the four top schools prior. this kid who barely cares about school lectured me and pointed out the connections that i once cared about and then had forgotten about following my illusion by threads like this. it was then that i realized i would not be applying early to a school I do not care about, nor would i be applying at all. so my advice to anybody reading this to snap the fuck out of it and find a school that works for you. for me, it’s NYU. I dream of New York City. I see artists hosting surprise concerts and doing events there and I dream of it. I saw kids riding the subway, kids just like me, leading that urban lifestyle, and dreamt of it. so fuck the prestige. find the university that you dream of. and the rest of it will come to you. and go to the basketball games, attend a school dance, participate in a spirit week. because you’ll never get to do it again.\n\nEDIT: every single time you try to compare stats or demean my application or act as though you’re better than me, you are doing nothing to actually improve your argument you are just proving my point. i am satisfied with what i’ve done and quite frankly just because i’m criticizing college admissions doesn’t mean i’m a weak applicant as which some of you have chosen to assume. stop comparing or demeaning other’s applications because it’s only showing your insecurities. be confident in yourself and in your argument if you have an argument against me rather than trying to attack my character."

Their reaction absolutely crushed me. They weren’t just disappointed, they were angry. They told me they don’t think I’m cut out for medicine.

My mom said my extracurriculars don’t matter - that being so involved on campus, or even my EMT job were all a waste of time. She said none of it mattered and that I basically wasted years of my life. Hearing that was devastating because I didn’t join these things for a resume line. I did them because I care about them deeply. Yes, I started EMT for the clinical exposure, but it turned into something so much bigger — being there for people in emergencies, growing through difficult situations. Same with my leadership work, I do it because I’m passionate about advocacy, not because I’m trying to pad my application. to hear her reduce all of that to “nothing” hurt in a way I can’t even describe.\n\nSo right now I just feel like a failure from every angle - my GPA isn’t where I want it, my MCAT score is low, and now my parents are telling me that everything I’ve done in the past few years doesn’t matter. They don’t see how much I’ve grown, how much I’ve poured into my work, or how passionate I am about the things I do. They just see the numbers and the rankings and decide I’m not good enough. \n\nI think what makes all of this even harder is that I’ve been working toward medicine for four years now. Everything I’ve done - classes, EMT shifts, leadership roles, late nights studying - has been with the goal of becoming a doctor. And now, with this score and with how my parents reacted, I feel like all of that effort might have been for nothing. I keep thinking maybe I need to switch careers, but the truth is I don’t even know what else I would do because medicine is all I’ve ever seen myself doing. I feel really, really stuck like I’m standing at a crossroads but neither path feels clear, and I’m terrified of making the wrong choice.\n\ni still want to be a doctor i really do. But with a 498 and a low GPA, and with my parents telling me I’m not capable, I just feel hopeless. Has anyone been in a situation like this? Has anyone started this low and still made it into med school? Or even just - how do you handle it when those you love completely lose faith in you? "

Ever.\n- If you do not read every word on that syllabus and note every quiz, exam, review session, paper, grading rubric, due date etc… you do so at your own peril.  \n- Even though that professor might never once utter the name “Geoffrey Chaucer” at any point in time during August, September, October, or November, it’s entirely possible that you’ll walk into class the day before Thanksgiving break and be stunned to find that the professor is collecting the term paper on the importance of the Canterbury Tales in establishing modern English literature as we know it… which is due that very day\n- You will be further stunned to learn that this term paper accounts for 25% of your final grade and if not turned in by the end of class that day (as noted on the syllabus) will be recorded as a ZERO\n- There will have never been reminders about that paper, unlike in high school \n- There will never have been interim due dates for an outline, or a first draft, or a second draft, or peer review sessions, unlike in high school\n- There will never have been emails home to your parents or a “parent resources” website where they can check to see what is due when, so your parents can make sure you’re keeping up with your work, unlike in high school\n- Unlike in high school, there will certainly be no meeting between you and your parents and your advisor and that teacher for your parents to beg for the opportunity for you to “make it up” at a later date or via some “extra credit assignment” nor will anyone want to hear why that’s important because you want to apply to a top Law/Med/Grad school some day\n- There will simply be a ZERO listed next to that assignment on Canvas… and the stark reality that the best grade you can ever possibly get in that class is now going to be a C — and a low C, at that according to the syllabus — assuming that you get a 100% on everything else… including attendance.  And while the professor never explicitly stated out loud that attendance counts toward 10% of your final grade, nor did they ever say anything to you about you missing class most Fridays, they will happily point out that this fact was also listed on the syllabus\n- And you will realize that cold day in November that your hopes of having a perfect 4.0 when you eventually apply to that top Law/Med/Grad school in a few years were torpedoed — by you and you alone — on that bright, sunny morning of your very first week on campus, when you didn’t review the syllabus.\n\nAnd this will not just be academic stuff.\n- You won’t know you forgot to pay your utility bill three days ago until you return to your apartment after class and find there’s no electricity… on a Friday at 5pm when it’s 95 degrees (or 55 degrees) in your apartment and the office doesn’t reopen until Tuesday (it’s a 3-day weekend).  There will, however, have been a clear paragraph in your lease explaining that is exactly what would happen if you didn’t pay your utility bill within three days of the due date.\n- You’re gonna be hungry towards the end each week the rest of the semester, because you won’t have been told on September 15th that “today” is the last day to change your meal plan. But you will have been told in May to read the full terms of the dining plan agreement that you blithely signed in June without a thought\n- Your car will be towed when you park somewhere that you think you should be able to park on a Saturday, even though that booklet you were given when you bought your student parking pass specifically says you can’t park there on any Saturday when there is a home football game\n- You will miss out on that class that you really need to take next semester in order to graduate on time because, when you went to sign up for it, you found out that there was a registration hold on your account. Seems you never submitted all your immunization records at the beginning of the semester, as outlined on the student health portal.\n- Speaking of the student health portal, one day in September your parents are going to call you, irate, asking why your account has been charged $3,500 for mandatory student health insurance.  $3,500 worth of insurance coverage that you don’t need because you’re already covered by your parents’ health insurance.  If only you had read that bold flashing banner that’s been on top of the portal since the first day of the semester telling you that the deadline to upload a picture of your insurance card in order to waive the $3,500 insurance charge was last week.\n\nSounds kind of dire? Maybe.\n\nIs it the reality? Absolutely. Each of the things described above happened to people I know.\n\nTL/DR: From this day forward — from submission of your applications straight through the day of your college graduation — you will need to be in the mode of being a proactive, diligent, fully-autonomous being.  AKA - an adult."

    "body": ">Universities nationwide are battling to pad their balance sheets by attracting families who will pay full sticker price, particularly as the Trump administration slashes funding. High Point University in North Carolina is something of a blueprint. Its model—catering to a wealthier student body—has fueled its enrollment growth, campus expansion and financial stability.\n\n>Dozens of carefully manicured gardens adorn the lush grounds. Students are almost always within earshot of a fountain; Qubein says the water has an energizing effect. Classical music plays around campus, and there are six outdoor heated swimming pools, each accompanied by a hot tub.\n\n>The school’s motto emphasizes “life skills.” Because job interviews and client deals often happen over meals, administrators want students to rehearse social etiquette. So they built a steakhouse, Mediterranean restaurant and Teppanyaki grill, where students can eat weekly as part of their meal plan. Reservations are required; phones banished. \n\n>Also on campus is an airplane-cabin interior, because sitting next to an executive on a plane could offer a golden opportunity—one young people should rehearse for. The campus concierge offers students airport shuttle service for free if they wear a High Point University shirt; otherwise it costs $95—a lesson in brand awareness.\n\nSome online critics deem High Point a “glorified country club,” a characterization students and administrators dispute. \n\nFull story here (free link): [https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/north-carolina-college-high-point-amenities-30b0fc14?st=ms13nC&mod=wsjreddit](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/north-carolina-college-high-point-amenities-30b0fc14?st=ms13nC&mod=wsjreddit)"

    "body": "Exactly what it sounds like; my college decisions ranked 19-1 by how much I cared about receiving them. Quick stats: I am a girl from Los Angeles, CA with a 3.6 UW and 4.2 W GPA, 33 ACT, and 5 major extracurriculars with 3 leadership roles. I am paying for college myself, but it’s a complicated situation financially. AMA!!! \n\nThe List\n\n19) California State University, Chico: Accepted \n\nI got into this school this morning despite never applying. Apparently, the Cal State redirected me here (spoilers, sorry) even though I never filled out a school preference for redirection. The more acceptances the merrier, I suppose. \n\n18) University of California, Merced: Accepted\n\nHonestly, I only applied here because it was free and the UC sent me an email asking me to apply. \n\n17) University of California, Riverside: Accepted\n\nSee Merced. \n\n16) University of Utah: Accepted with Scholarship\n\nThe first college I submitted my application to! Seemed like a really good backup school in the interest of saving money, as in addition to WUE, I also received a merit scholarship, giving me a total $17k discount. However, I said no because although I really love the Utahan mountain landscape, I'm really not a fan of the politics. \n\n15) Smith College: Waitlisted -> Rejected\n\nApplied because it was free and seemed cool. I realized that a women's college wasn’t for me pretty soon after I submitted it. I got waitlisted and did not care by that point so I didn't write a LOCI and got rejected off the waitlist.\n\n14) Northeastern University: Waitlisted -> Accepted (NY Scholars) with Scholarship\n\nAlso applied here for free. I was surprised to get waitlisted because the acceptance rate was in the single digits, and I was even more surprised to get into their New York Scholars program with a $7k scholarship off the waitlist because 1) my best friend who is WAY smarter than me (she's going to Northwestern) got straight up rejected  and 2) I didn't realize one could get a merit scholarship off the waitlist. Still too expensive though. \n\n13) Fordham University (Rose Hill): Accepted with Scholarship \n\nApplied here for free as well, but got in with $33k in merit! Was super into this school for like 5 minutes because I really wanted to live in New York, but then realized that being that far from where I and my family live in LA was lowkey scary… Also, even with the money, Fordham was still borderline more expensive than my favorite school I got into.\n\n12) University of Oregon: Accepted with Scholarship \n\nFirst school I got into! I really loved this campus and Eugene, and I liked how affordable it was (I got $13k in merit). However, I didn't like how far it was from a major city, a factor I found somewhat important, especially at a school further from home.\n\n11) Loyola University Chicago: Accepted with Scholarship\n\nLowkey fell in love with Loyola, especially since I got $31k in merit which made it the fifth cheapest school I got into. In addition to that, I had a hard time saying no to being in the same city as my best friend, but LUC’s lack of name recognition and school culture compared to other schools I was accepted to unfortunately made me decide not to attend.\n\n10) University of Miami: Deferred -> Waitlisted -> Rejected\n\nI actually really liked the idea of going here because I LOVE Miami as a city and I really liked the idea of going to like a big \"school spirit\" footbally school, but MY GOD is Miami expensive. Because of the cost, I didn't super care after I got deferred and then waitlisted (make up your mind, Miami).\n\n9) New York University: Rejected \n\nSimilar to Miami. I LOVE LOVE LOVE New York, but it was so insanely expensive that I didn't really mind getting rejected.\n\n8) University of California, Santa Cruz: Accepted\n\nThe first on this list that I truly considered going to! I really loved the campus (and the price tag, being in state), but I just couldn't wrap my head around the relative isolation that Santa Cruz has from major cities without a car, and the housing crisis and relative lack of traditional, social “school spirit” scared me off a bit. Sorry, banana slugs.\n\n7) California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo: Rejected\n\nHonestly, this was my only rejection that I was truly surprised by. I would have liked to go to SLO because I really liked its very low price, beach culture, and 3-hour train distance from my house, but I wasn't devasted about the rejection because I was (again) a little off-put about the distance from a city.\n\n6) George Washington University: Accepted with Scholarship\n\n I really really liked GWU, and as someone who wants to go into politics as a profession, this school seemed like a great idea in terms of location. However, even with $17k in merit, the school was just over my hard cutoff price of $70k a year. Plus, DC was a little further from home than was ideal. I'm okay with my decision, but I feel a little sad at what might have been every time I watch the West Wing. DC, I'll come back for you someday (maybe for law school).\n\n5) University of Colorado, Boulder: Accepted \n\nThis was by FAR my HARDEST school to turn down. I literally agonized over my decision until like April 28th (talk about a buzzer-beater). I loved, like, EVERYTHING about Boulder. I loved the Flatirons. I loved the hiking culture. I loved the major party scene and Greek life. I loved the STUNNING campus and college town. But there was one school I loved more…\n\n4) San Diego State University: Waitlisted -> Rejected\n\nThis decision was unexpectedly disappointing; I was one of very few of my friends who didn’t get in, and I really would have liked to go here. I liked the city vibe and distance from home, to say nothing of the beach and the SUPER LOW price. But like… whatever…\n\n3) The school I chose! See end of list. \n\n2) University of California, San Diego: Waitlisted -> Rejected\n\nI liked UCSD just as much as the school I chose, but if I had gotten accepted here, I probably would have gone because it was bit cheaper and closer to home, while still being far enough away that it was different. Plus, well, the beach.\n\n1) University of California, Berkeley: Rejected \n\nEven though I knew I wasn't getting in, this was still lowkey devasting. I really would have loved Berkeley, I loved its prestige, school spirit, low price, and closeness to San Francisco, my favorite city. Oh well.\n\nFinally, \nWhat I picked: UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, SEATTLE! \n\nWhile choosing between UW and Boulder was really hard, UW was the right choice for me in the end. I loved that it was in a big city with many opportunities, I loved the major school spirit I saw all around campus, I loved its relative prestige, and I loved the beauty of the campus and Seattle itself. I'm so excited to go here this fall, GO DAWGS!"

I'm in 2 clubs that I attend somewhat regularly. I'm often in a good mood so I am cheerful and excited to talk to people. \n\nPeople often laugh at my jokes, and I can often get the entire class laughing including the teacher.

    "body": "Despite the title, I'm genuinely so serious about this, although it is somewhat true LOL. As you all know, the college commitment deadline, May 1st, is in less than a week, but I still haven’t committed to a college yet. I'm having a really tough time deciding where to commit and would love any advice.\n\nI’m currently considering these four colleges:\n\n1. **RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology)** \n\n**Major**: Computer Engineering\n\n2. **Purdue University**; Purdue Polytechnic Institute at Purdue University in West Lafayette \n\n**Major**: Computer Engineering\n\n3. **NYU**; Tandon School of Engineering\n\n**Major**: Electrical & Computer Engineering\n\n4. **NEU (Northeastern University)**; Khoury College of Computer Science, Oakland first year → Boston\n\n**Major**: Computer Science\n\nHere are some of the important factors I’m considering and concerns I have about these schools:\n\n**MAJOR:**\n\nWhen I applied to college, I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to major in computer SCIENCE or computer ENGINEERING, and honestly, I’m still not very sure. I don’t know which one is more suitable for me. I took APCSA this year, and honestly, I did not like it. BUT, I can definitely recount times where I’ve really enjoyed coding, so I’m not sure if this class was an exception/anomaly. OVERALL, I’M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT WHAT MAJOR I WANT TO DO, BUT I DEFINITELY KNOW IT’S WITHIN THE STEM FIELD. \n\nJust in case, I’d also like to know how easy it is to switch majors at these schools (both within and between schools).\n\n**RANKING:**\n\n**NYU**: I’ve heard some mixed opinions on Tandon’s reputation. While NYU seems way more selective, the ranking for Tandon is #27 for CS and #42 for engineering on US News. If I wanted to switch to CS within Tandon, how hard would that be? \n\n**NEU**: For NEU, I heard that they’re changing their entire curriculum soon, and it feels a little risky since I don’t know how that’ll turn out. I’ve also heard a lot of criticism on NEU’s acceptance rate/ranking inflation, and the fact that they still haven’t sent me my financial aid package is not helping 💀. \n\n**Purdue**: Though I have a few concerns about the school (read in “Social Life/Campus Life”), Purdue is ranked very highly for engineering, so I’m wondering if the strength of the program compensates for those concerns.\n\n**RIT**: It’s the cheapest option, and it’s ranked #6 for co-op programs, but I’m not sure if I can see myself staying there for all 4 years. If I go to RIT, I’d probably want to transfer out after the first year. Does anyone know how hard it is to transfer from RIT into a better-ranked school as a CS/CE major, and whether I should just try to transfer no matter where I go for my first year?\n\n**FINANCIAL AID**:\n\nIn terms of financial aid, the cost goes:\n\n1. **RIT**, 21k\n2. **Purdue**, 50k\n3. **NYU**, 70k\n4. **NEU**; haven’t received my financial aid package yet\n\nAlthough cost IS a factor that I’m considering while making this decision, if the opportunities, experiences, and education is better at a school that is more expensive, I’m willing to invest in that. Additionally, I’ve heard of people who have gotten co-ops or internships that lower the cost of their tuition, and sometimes even cover it entirely. I want to know if this is realistic for me at my more expensive schools. \n\n**LOCATION**:\n\nI live in NY, and while my parents want me to stay close, it isn’t super high on my priority list.\n\n* **NYU**: less than an hour drive\n* **NEU**: 3-hour drive\n* **RIT**: 6-hour drive\n* **Purdue**: All the way in Indiana (so via plane)\n\n**SOCIAL LIFE/CAMPUS LIFE:**\n\nI haven’t visited any of these schools, so I’m not very familiar with the campus and social life (please give thoughts on this, especially if you’re a current student!!)\n\n* **NYU**: I got into NYU as a spring semester admit. I’m worried that this will affect my ability to make friends, find roommates, and get involved. Does anyone know how spring admits usually handle housing and social life? Can I dorm with people who started in the fall? Also, what do spring admits even do during the fall semester?\n* **NEU**: I’d be starting at the Oakland campus for my first year, and then transferring to Boston. I feel like I’d be missing out socially by not being in Boston my first year. How’s the transition process and how is Oakland?\n* **Purdue**: It’s a very rural place, so I’m worried that it might feel isolating or overwhelming to me, considering I’ve spent my entire life in NYC.\n\n**SUMMARY**:\n\n* Overall, how do these schools compare for Computer Science/Engineering (and electrical for NYU)?\n* How easy is it to switch majors at each school?\n* Which school best prepares you for your future and offers the most opportunities or co-op/internships?\n* What are the social scenes like, especially for spring admits at NYU and Oakland campus students at NEU?\n* How much should I care about the rankings/reputation?\n* Are these tuitions worth it?\n* How easy is it to transfer out of any of these schools if I don’t feel like it’s the best fit?\n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTE:**\n\n* I did get a **guaranteed admission for fall 2026 to BU** (College of Engineering for CE); is this worth transferring into? \n\nThank you so much to anyone who took the time to read all this 😢 I really appreciate any advice or personal experiences you have!\n\n**UPDATE INQUIRY:**\n\nTHANK YOU FOR ALL THE RESPONSES AND ADVICE. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT! After reading all the suggestions, Purdue is definitely coming on top. However, I did see a few comments talking about Purdue Polytechnic vs Purdue College of Engineering. From what I understand, Purdue College of Engineering offers a more traditional and rigorous engineering program, and Purdue Polytechnic seems to have a more applied, hands-on approach, but overall, less prestigious than the College of Engineering. That said, I’m wondering if Purdue Polytechnic is still the strongest choice? Is it hard to transfer to the College of Engineering?\n\nAlso a lot of people are saying RIT is great for co-ops, what about NEU? It's ranked higher in terms of co-op, is it the same or better?"

    "body": "It truly baffles me how many people I speak to tell me their university experience was the best time of their lives. \n\nI am from London. I decided to study medicine, being from a low income family and fears of being evicted from our flat, my dad came up with the idea to not apply to any London universities and study elsewhere so it’s cheaper, medicine is the same anywhere so I accepted. I ended up going to medical school outside of London.\n\nI absolutely hated it. I tried to go to events and all of that stuff initially but after freshers I genuinely just stayed cocooned in my room. I found everyone so cliquey and weird, so different from college where I had such a great time in comparison. \n\nThere was such a different demographic of people there, about 25% of students were from china and wouldn’t interact with anyone else, most of the rest were from extremely posh and privileged backgrounds that I couldn’t really tolerate for long. It didn’t help that medical school isolates you from the rest of the university so after a while I almost only interacted with medics who came with so many draining cliques of their own. I basically only had 6 proper friends throughout my entire time at uni and would hardly interact with most of them. \n\nCOVID hit near the end of first year and I ended up spending the entirety of second year at home in London. In 3rd year of med school you stop having campus lectures which sucked because campus was probably the nicest part of the uni. The disruption actually screwed me over and I feel into a deep depression in 3rd year. Truly the only time I felt happy in uni was when I went home to London, and seeing all my proper friends. \n\nMy girlfriend studies in London and the lifestyle just looks sooo much nicer, so many more things to do and see. I got envious despite having been born and raised in London, I feel like I completely missed out on the London uni experience and it kills me.\n\nYou’d think with me not going out much/getting involved with anything I’d be doing well academically. The reality is I barely passed my exams, I did well enough not to fail any which a lot of the cohort would do and have to retake, but I wasn’t exceptional at all. Meanwhile my course mates would be doing crazy shit like publishing research and presenting at conferences. It’s such a huge contrast from how academic I was in school being at the top of the class for everything getting straight A*/As. I hated the way they teach you in uni with so much of it being independent, I had such little motivation to do anything outside of lectures. So much of my motivation in school was driven from validation from my teachers who I loved very much, at uni the lecturers don’t even know who you are/don’t care. \n\nI’ve graduated now and I do prefer working life but fuck me I feel like I completely wasted 5 years of my so called prime life just being in depression.

    "body": "Just got back from my MIT interview, here's the questions I was asked and how it all went down:\n\nI showed up to the coffee shop a bit early, to be ready to meet him as soon as he walked in the door. I immediately ran up to greet him - we ended up going outside bc there were no seats inside. We made small talk about interview locations, the coffee shop itself, etc. I was mad stressed at first bc I forgot my credit card and I thought we'd be drinking something, but thankfully we were only inside for like 5 seconds. Now here's what he asked me:\n\n**Why MIT?**\n\n* I talked about what I looked for in a college (had this down to a tee) and then I talked about the MIT-specific opportunities and how they align with what I look for. A big part of what I talked about was research, which allowed a segue into the next question.\n\n**You've talked a lot about future research, do you have past research experience you'd like to touch on?**\n\n* My time to shine. I yapped about my research internships - this guy works at the lab I interned at, so while he didn't know anything about my team and projects specifically, he was familiar with the systems. His group actually had a member doing something very similar to what I did, so we yapped about research (his and mine) for a while.\n\n**Any further questions for me?**\n\n* He led with this a bit early, and I was kinda worried that the interview would end short, so I knew I had to yap. I asked what he remembered the most about his time at MIT (he graduated over 50 years ago).  He yapped A LOT here, and we had a nice conversation about values. Then he talked about the community aspect of MIT and how they look for people who can collaborate, and I was like, oh shoot, I haven't talked about collaboration yet at all. Luckily that was his next question.\n\n**Have you worked with a team and collaborated with others?**\n\n* I yapped about clubs and research, and eventually transitioned to teaching kids. Here we had a nice conversation since he used to teach youth athletics at my age (as do I now), so we both talked a lot about our experiences.\n\n**Any further questions pt. 2**\n\n* I asked were about whether he was involved in any student groups/clubs (which allowed us to talk about our interests). He also talked a lot about student life here.\n\n**I know you're busy from the stuff you've told me; what else do you do for fun?**\n\n* I yapped about jogging and chess. He's a swimmer and I'm a runner, so we talked about triathlons for a while bc we both know people who have done them. Got sidetracked a lot here.\n\n**Further questions pt. 3**\n\n* I asked him what advice he would give to himself when he was entering MIT (ie what would he change). At first he said he didn't have many regrets, but as we talked further he said he wished he took advantage of more opportunities MIT gave him, and also that he connected with his professors more and asked questions outside of class.\n\n**Anything you'd like me to tell the AOs that they don't already know from your app?**\n\n* I said no, I think the app did a great job of condensing who I am at my core. Then we yapped about the MIT app for a while, and different colleges and opportunities there. He said as long as you take advantage of all the opportunities you're given and put in a lot, you'll be fine no matter where you go to college. We talked a bit about our local college, which we've both done research at.\n\n**Any questions about financial aid?**\n\n* No. Pretty simple. We talked a bit more after this, but it was all superficial and it had been about an hour, so we parted ways.\n\nAll in all, it definitely felt more like a conversation than an interview - we just talked about our interests, and anytime there was a lull in the conversation, I kept coming back to ask him questions about his experience. Definitely wasn't an interrogation or anything like that - felt way more like 2 people having a pleasant back and forth. I think it went well - he told me he could definitely see me at MIT and that I was a good fit, but they get so many applications that 3/4 of the people who are good fits don't get in. He said the process felt like throwing darts at application files, which I thought was funny coming from an interviewer. I was also a bit surprised that he didn't ask me \"why major\" since I had a great answer prepared, but he just seemed to accept that I was interested in math (which I touched on in \"why MIT\") without asking why.\n\nIf I had any advice, 100% know a lot of stuff about the school. Envision yourself on campus - what classes you're excited for, what clubs you'd join, what labs you'd do research at, etc. Even if you only get to bring up 10% of it, better safe than sorry. I felt uber prepared, so I got to pick what I wanted to highlight. If your interviewer is older, use the opportunity to get wisdom - if they're younger, use it to understand the current student life. Treat it like a friendly conversation, don't be too nervous, speak slowly and clearly, and bring water.\n\nGood luck to my fellow applicants!!"

    "body": "This past year I've been interested in how smartphones impacted our society. I recently talked to someone who was in college 2010-14 and said the smartphone takeover of their college was mind boggling. Saying in 2010, you would never see someone on campus on their phone unless they were on a call, by 2013 the campus felt different and most people seemed hooked to their phones.\n\nI began my first year of college in 2014, which was also the same year I got my first smartphone, my peers and I's social life was dominated by our smartphone use. This was breakout years of Snapchat and Instagram, where it wasn't uncommon for be hanging out in the dining hall or a party and constantly be on your phone at the same time. Where before social media was a place to upload pictures of your social life, with smartphone apps in our pockets, now social media was our social life.\n\nI look back on my college years now and can't believe how much my peers and I were on our smartphones when hanging out. By my senior year, it was hard to even watch a movie with friends and roommates without almost everyone being on their phones the entire time. Honestly, college was some of the loneliest years of my life. I began missing high school when hanging out with friends felt more in the moment and everyone wasn't hooked to their screens. I remember before 2012 smartphones were looked at as something only rich people had, but by 2013 they became more common. In 2014, I was the last of my friends to get a smartphone and got it mostly to fit in.\n\nWhen I entered college, it was the first year the majority of the population had a smartphone and we had no idea how addictive these apps were, or how they were impacting our attention spans and mental health.\n\nWhen I entered college smartphones had already taken over, so I'm interested to hear from people who were in college as smartphones began to grow in popularity."

Hope it’s useful.\n\n**1) Start with questions your résumé can’t answer**\n\nForget lists of accomplishments. Focus on moments and experiences. Ask yourself:\n\nWhat’s a moment or experience in your life that changed the way you see the world?  \nWhat are you most passionate about right now? What can you talk about for hours?  \nWhat's something quirky, unusual, or unexpected about you that most people don't know at first glance?\n\nThis is exactly how a counselor would interview you. The answers that feel honest, specific, or unusual are usually gold.\n\n**2) Reverse-engineer the admissions office**\n\nAdmissions officers are building a community. They look for:\n\nIntellectual curiosity  \nCollaboration  \nGrowth from failure  \nA perspective they don’t already have\n\nWhatever story you tell, you want these traits come through clearly. Structure your outline accordingly.\n\n**3) Thread the needle**\n\nYour essay should have one central idea that ties it all together. If you open with a story about performing magic, echo that mindset in your academics, leadership, or challenges. And always show, don’t just tell. It’s stronger to describe what you taught yourself in your spare time than to say you’re curious.\n\n**4) Synthesize**\n\nEnd with a line that makes the reader think, “I want this person on my campus.” Leave them with a strong sense of who you are and how you’ll contribute.\n\nThese steps seem simple—but they’re not easy to apply well. That’s why college counselors exist! :)\n\nHappy to answer any questions, if helpful."

    "score": 110,
    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1lp2she/two_simultaneous_truthsthe_ivy_league_paradox/",
    "body": "As a current student at Columbia University and a serial college essay editor for friends, family, and recently, clients, I’ve had lots of experience with Ivy League schools and students. For the sake of this post, I’ll be including any school with Ivy League-level prestige, such as MIT, UChicago, etc., when I refer to the \"Ivies\" (and please, let's not debate what schools these are here). Now, what I'm going to address in this post are two contradictory ideas that I think are vital to understanding what going to a prestigious school means.\n\nThe first concept is that **these schools are all very, very different, and aren't all for you**. If you simply \"want to go to an Ivy\" and only apply to the highest-ranked schools, then I'll go as far as to say that you won't succeed in this process. *Maybe* you'll get into the school, but if the driving force in your decision making regarding the place you're going to be rigorously studying the next 4 years of your life is that \"it's prestigious,\" then you have no idea what these schools are about and what the education means. And it will show on your application. And you'll feel it in your first semester. The cultural, academic, and social differences are so drastically different between these schools that you simply cannot sweepingly 'apply Ivy League' without making a big misstep in your process. I understand the impulse to do this, I understand you want to give yourself and your current/future family the best possible opportunities, and going to a highly rated school will do this. But I promise that if you can't decide for any reason beyond that then you simply aren't going to be happy at college.\n\n**However**, the second point is that **highly rated schools are highly rated for a reason.** This sounds obvious, but hear me out. Almost everyone I know who ended up at the prestigious school they eventually graduated from went through a learning process where their opinions on their favorite schools changed. I know transfers to lower-ranked schools from Ivies, transfers to higher-ranked schools, people who got denied from their top choice and loved their safety, and vice versa. But the most consistent trend I've seen in students enjoying where they end up is the baseline quality of that school. What does this mean? It means what's the endowment like, how are the dorms, how is the food, are the students smart? For better or for worse, these are issues that almost never arise in the Ivy League. This is because of the absurd inequality in the quality of life in the college system, and it's pretty messed up. But it's also the truth. I imagine that no matter where I ended up, if it was in the top 20 or whatever, I probably would've found my people and enjoyed my time there. And so would/will you.\n\n**Okay, so after I've told you that your parents are both completely right and completely wrong about prestigious schools, let me give you my \\*cough\\* professional advice.** **Look into the schools you apply to.** I mean *really* look into them; make sure you have at least 5 professors per school you'd like to study with, a good grasp of the campus and nearby area, and a general view of what your life would look like there. This is the quickest way to not have the Brown-MIT situation, meaning if you'd prefer doing math competitions and forming tech startups more than singing around a campfire, you might gain some insight on which school you'd prefer. But here's the kicker, unless there is some massive cultural mismatch: **you'd probably love both**. If you're a smart, dedicated individual, a prestigious school with people who love learning will feel like home. Full stop. You're also young and will change so much even before your first day on campus, so don't feel so certain about questions of big vs. small, city vs. nature.\n\nSo what I recommend is, as I mentioned earlier, to weigh the schools individually, identify their unique qualities, and try and honestly consider whether they appeal to you on academic grounds as well as social. Then, pick your number of reach schools you're going to apply to (which, even for the strongest applicant, is any Ivy League), I'd recommend 5 for a strong applicant with good time management. Then whittle the total list down till you reach a small number of schools you're passionate about for concrete reasons, ideally intersecting both the academic and non-academic criteria. This will prevent your applications from turning into generic mush, which is what happens if you just blindly pick highly rated schools. But (I know this is getting ridiculous with the caveats), don't stay married to any set list you made! Keep an open mind and try and imagine yourself growing at the school and not the school growing with you. All of these places will foster a strong education where you'll learn and meet your people.\n\n**Long story short: research, research, research, because of the paradoxical truth that you probably will** ***and*** **won't love all these schools.**"

    "body": "I'm currently seeing lots of posts on here about people debating turning down higher ranked schools for lower ranked schools. As someone who did this (>10 years ago now), I wanted to share my perspective now that I'm well on the other side of college and into my career. \n\nWhen I applied to college, I was very fortunate to have excellent results - I got in nearly everywhere I applied, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford (except Duke, where I am pretty confident I was yield protected lol). I also received a full merit scholarship to my state school (UNC-Chapel Hill). \n\nI received the UNC scholarship before I got in to any other schools (I didn't apply early anywhere, only regular decision). I was pretty sure that no matter what happened with my other schools, I was going to take the UNC scholarship (because I did not qualify for much financial aid). But then when I opened acceptance after acceptance, it was both exciting but also devastating knowing I was going to have to turn down these places that I had dreamed about attending for years and years. It was really hard at the time but I accepted the scholarship at UNC and tried to not look back.   \n  \nTo be honest, the first year at UNC was a bit difficult while I adjusted to the huge state school experience and questioned whether I made the right decision. But bit by bit, I feel absolutely in love with UNC. I made wonderful friends, had fantastic relationships with my professors, and really felt like a part of a special community. I was able to excel at UNC, and graduated with opportunities I could never have dreamed of, like multiple full ride scholarships to tip-top graduate schools. I'm now a professor at a T10 university and I credit so many of the opportunities I've had to the fact that I chose UNC and was able to really stand out there. \n\nAll this to say, I've recently spent a lot of time in fairly 'elite' academic circles - whether through my prestigious grad scholarships or working at a T10. And the range of universities that the highly successful people I am fortunate to be surrounded by is really astonishing. So many of the smartest and most successful people I know did not go to the best of the best universities. Yes, those places can open some doors for you and provide you with lots of connections into an elite world, but by excelling at a lower ranked school, you absolutely can get many similar opportunities. I now do grad school admissions as part of my job, and a student from a T100 with an great GPA, strong references, great research and/or work experiences has every bit the same chance as getting in to our program as your typical applicant from a T10 school. \n\nThere was also another advantage of going to UNC in that I was saved a bit from the competitiveness and GPA/EC 'rat race' that you find at many elite universities. I had a 3.9 GPA in a STEM major during undergrad, but I don't remember ever being super stressed about my grades or specific coursework. At UNC, I felt pressure to be involved on campus and seek out leadership positions, but there wasn't much academic competitiveness nor any sort of overwhelming emphasis on your coursework and grades. This was SO good for me as someone who was hyper-competitive and grade-focused in high school. I was recently talking to a friend of mine from UNC who went on to a T3 medical school about how different our undergrad experience was from our grad school friends who went to T10s. We really think our successes in grad school were largely driven by the fact that we weren't overly stressed and burned out when we finished undergrad. \n\nMost importantly, once you get to college, all your achievements 'reset', so to speak. None of my post-college applications for grad school, jobs, etc, had even one ounce of information about anything I did in high school. While this can seem intimidating for someone who really excelled in high school (it was for me at the time), please know that it's not like you become a different person in college and in all likelihood you will be able to continue on your success. Mostly though I'm just trying to tell you that (1) you absolutely do need to keep working hard in college to be successful but (2) do not let anything you did or didn't do in high school hold you back from achieving your goals. \n\nI'll end there even though there's far more I could say about my experiences. But I really want to reassure those of you on this subreddit that where you go to college does not determine the trajectory of the rest of your life, and it is what you do there that matters. Best of luck to you all!"

    "body": "Every year lots and lots of applicants are deferred from some of their favorite colleges. It sucks when life doesn’t go your way for sure, but maybe it helps to know that you’re not alone?\n\nNow, what do you do with that deferral? For starters, it's important to focus on whatever you might still need to do for your regular decision schools. And, there are lots of amazing schools still taking applications, where you can find and be your awesome self – I’ll be making posts throughout the semester with lists of colleges still accepting applications. Remember, you have you wherever you are.\n\nHowever, if you are, indeed, still interested in a college that has deferred you — and the school doesn’t specifically ask you not to write one or send one, start thinking about your letter of continued interest (LOCI). Some amazing advice from u/ScholarGrade: “it's hard to take the time and energy to actually send something. So many students don't bother because they see the stats on how few students get in off waitlists and just give up. Don't let this be you. I also once heard a Cornell AO say that they don't really bother looking at deferred applications where no update was received because they figure that if you really want to go there, you'll send something. TL;DR - Send something. Actually, do it. You have nothing to lose, and it could change your life.”\n\nIf you’re still reeling, or even grieving, from the effects of the excitement of December Decisions mutating to becoming December Deferred, you’re not alone. And while you can’t force yourself to feel happy, you can do something fun -- dance, sing, eat ice cream, and wear funny clothes. That definitely does not mean pushing bad feelings away. It just means giving those feelings a break. I recently wrote a couple of posts about how to deal with admissions stress:\n\n[What to do when decisions don’t go your way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1hexrz9/hello_beautiful_seniors_if_early_admissions_2024/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[College admissions decisions, wind, and why a little stress just might be good for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1hdging/college_admissions_decisions_wind_and_why_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Emotional Planning](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1h9uc7z/hello_class_of_2025_if_you_applied_early_its_time/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI know many of you have strong support systems among your families and friends, but if you find yourself struggling, you might find something that speaks to you in those posts. And you can always reach out to me, too. Here’s a great [blog](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2020/12/02/what-does-being-deferred-mean/) from Rick Clark, former Director of Admissions from Georgia Tech; it's about dealing with the stress of admissions and life, not specifically about how to write a LOCI, but some of you might find it helpful. Aside from the fact that he mentions Reddit (I’m sure he must mean A2C ;)), he always has amazing wisdom to share. I’m also going to share this [blog](https://tuadmissionjeff.blogspot.com/2011/12/ive-been-deferred-now-what.html) from the former Director of Admissions at Tulane about what to do if deferred.\n\n# Some LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest) guidelines from me you might find helpful:\n\n**Dos**\n\n1. Read the Instructions from the School: Use the method the college asks you to use in their letter. Some have a specific form. Some want you to upload to a certain place. Some have certain deadlines. Some say not to send anything at all. Read your letter carefully and check their blogs and your portal to ensure they haven't explained anything further.\n2. If they don’t say ***not*** to send something -- Send Something: If they *don't* mention your sending them updates or a letter to confirm interest in a certain format or say they don't want anything at all, send an email LOCI to your AO for your area or the dean of admissions if the college doesn’t have specific AOs for your area. Copy the general admissions office and the person whose name is on your letter. They might also have a portal for you to share anything they need.\n3. Keep it short and sweet. Do not take up too much of their time. I’d keep it within two pages, double-spaced (250 - 500 words). Make your points concisely and clearly. This is a little more business-like than your personal statement. You need to be polite, but also share your voice and be friendly and warm.\n4. Tell them they remain your first choice if they truly are. If you will attend if you get accepted, let them know this -- if it's true.\n5. Express your continued interest. Let them know that you are happy to be part of the regular decision pool now, and why it is such a good fit for you. Think of this part as a mini Why College Essay/love letter, and let them know what you can bring to their school specifically. It’s your job to paint a picture of yourself on their campus with specific details about how you will participate and be engaged with your college experience on their campus.\n6. Share any important updates to your application if you have them. Examples of applicable updates are improved test scores or grades, a visit to the college, a major award or honor -- or some personal goal you’ve accomplished this semester from a hobby or interest can also work.\n7. Thank them again and show your appreciation.\n8. Extenuating Circumstances: If you have or had any extenuating circumstances that could help them evaluate your application that you didn't address already, you could include it briefly here in your LOCI, or you could send a different email or submit it to the portal explaining your situation. Sometimes you don’t feel right in your application explaining hardships, but it’s the kind of information they need to know to understand the context of your application.\n9. Additional Letters of Recommendation: Some colleges will accept additional letters of recommendation if they explore a different area of who you are. Again, read their materials carefully. If they do accept additional LORs and you have someone who could write one for you to add something a little different, try to arrange that.\n10. Send it in mid-January, a couple of weeks after they are back in session. No need to send it much sooner. Your regular decision apps come first. If they have a quick form to fill out to acknowledge your interest, go ahead and fill that out and send it now. **Always follow the instructions they give.**\n11. Send an update to your interviewer: Thank them for their time, and just tell them you’re updating to let them know. Don’t expect or ask them to do anything, but maybe they’ll have some insight to share or advice.\n\n**Don’ts**\n\n1. Don’t send a letter if they tell you not to in your deferral letter.\n2. Don't send it before you've completed your regular decision apps.\n3. Don’t express anger or frustration. It’s ok to share disappointment briefly but don’t be whiny or pouty.\n4. Don’t make any assumptions about your acceptance or lack thereof.\n5. Don’t make your letter too long.\n6. Don't send regular updates. One or two updates are enough.\n7. Don’t ask the college for feedback on your application.\n\nTl;dr: 1) Send something unless the college specifically tells you not to. 2) Follow their directions. 3) Like everything else in college admissions, there is no magic formula. All you can do is get advice and then decide what makes the most sense for you. Others might have different advice than mine. That’s totally ok. You read it all and learn, and then figure out what works best for you.\n\nXOXOXO AdmissionsMom"

    "body": "# AdmissionsMom's 2025 Timeline for (almost) Rising Juniors and Seniors\n\nHello Almost Rising Juniors and Seniors (*and almost rising sophomores hold on to this*)!\n\nThis is basically an abbreviated version of pretty much everything I say throughout the year; hopefully, it's organized in a way you can find useful.\n\nJunior year is where your college admissions journey starts for real. You now have quite a few items to tick off your to-do list.\n\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT:  Don't out if you're already a rising senior -- (or even a fall semester senior for that matter if you’re reading this much later). You still have plenty of time.\n\nPlease note that my views about what to do when and what I emphasize might be different from the advice you hear from other sources and other students, counselors, or consultants. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.\n\nHere’s how I suggest you tackle this list. If you are new to admissions, no matter where you are in high school, start reading here from the beginning. Don’t panic. It’s totally ok if you haven’t done any of the stuff on the list. Most kids haven’t. I’m just providing a timeline for “an ideal world” situation.\n\n# Rising Junior Summer (Summer before Junior Year)\n\nENJOY YOUR SUMMER: This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. Be sure to take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nACTIVITIES: I love what MIT Admissions says: \"Some students feel so much pressure to get into the “right” college that they want to make sure they do everything right—down to their extracurricular activities. Fortunately, the only right answer is to do what’s right for you—not what you think is right for us. Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don’t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy—whether it feels right for you. College is not a costume party; you’re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you’ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you’re ready to try.”\n\nGET INVOLVED WITH STUFF\n\n* Yourself (Exercise healthy habits, engage in personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, get a job, learn something new that’s good for your brains like guitar or Italian, practice mindfulness and meditation).\n* Your family (Help with sibs or grandparents, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, or take care of dinner one night a week).\n* Your community (Community service can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects. Volunteer to play your instrument or play games at a retirement home, coach a kids’ team, make sandwiches at a food bank, or make comfort bags and drop off healthy snacks and water to people who might not have access to housing).\n\nGET A SUMMER JOB: Just an old-fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.\n\nTESTING\n\n* PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT: You take it in October, and it helps you qualify for National Merit if you score high enough.\n* PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT: Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of your junior year. Definitely take one in the early part of the spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start your senior year.\n* Even though many colleges are continuing to be Test Optional, I encourage you to continue to prep for and take the tests because the list of colleges requiring tests is changing.\n\nSTART YOUR RESUME: If you haven’t already, make a list of all the activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. I suggest making a spreadsheet, where you have columns for the name of the activity, your title, your leadership, your impact, lessons learned or impact on you, years that you've been involved, and an estimate of your hours per week. Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old-fashioned summer or part-time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to more traditional research, internships, and in-or-out-of-school clubs and sports.\n\nEXPLORE THE WORLD OF ADMISSIONS: Read some college admissions websites and blogs. Some of my favorites are Georgia Tech, MIT, Tulane, UVA, Johns Hopkins, and Tufts. They are open about the realities and anxieties of college admissions.\n\n# Junior Fall\n\nPretty much all of the summer stuff still applies.\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nTAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN: You can read more about Course Selection [in my post, Making your Course Selections Count](https://admissionsmom.college/course-selection/making-your-course-selections-count-2023/). Colleges say your course rigor counts for more than your GPA and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. I recommend that you take four years of:\n\n* Science (including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)\n* Foreign Language (many highly selective colleges like to see four years of a foreign language during high school. I know you don’t want to. It’s also good for your brain. [Here’s a doc with my explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6EB7rSSrDV6ovPjl3ndD8Vc17cYt4Wlo3YkA5kiLOo/edit?usp=sharing))\n* English\n* Math (ending in Calculus if it’s available and offered (especially if you want to be competitive for highly rejective colleges) -- or higher)\n* Social Science (History, Gov, etc)\n\nCheck out the course requirements or suggestions on the web pages of some colleges that might interest you.\n\nGET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS: Visit them during office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. Speak up in class. Ask for help when you need it. Be polite. Say thank you after class. Acknowledge their hard work and use their wisdom.\n\nKEEP UP YOUR GRADES: I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials. Meet with your teachers after class. Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other YouTube videos if you’re struggling. Don’t wait and get far behind. Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now.\n\nREAD READ READ: Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. Read real books, magazines, newspapers, and more real books. Read books that are required for school and books just for fun. I can suggest lots — ask me! READ FICTION!!!!\n\nKEEP PREPPING AND PRACTICING FOR THE ACT AND SAT: Start your testing in the late fall or early spring of Junior Year if it’s available to you.\n\nSTAY INVOLVED: Keep up with everything I listed for summer (involved with yourself, your family, your community). [I talk at length about extracurricular activities and finding your star-shaped self in this post](https://admissionsmom.college/activities/). Get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or simply do individual activities that add to your school environment. Sit with someone new at lunch once a week. Make an effort to say hello to two new people a week. Find a need and fill it. Or, as [this Georgia Tech blog says,](https://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) find what makes you happy, and do it.\n\nCHECK-IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR: See what they have to advise and how the process works at your school. Every school is slightly different. Let them get to know you, too.\n\n# Junior Spring\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nLETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. Some colleges have certain expectations for recommenders, so be sure to read college admissions websites about what they are looking for. For lots more in-depth info, [here’s a post about getting those Letters of Recommendation. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nCOLLEGE VISITS: Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you might consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Hang out on campus. Then, if you can go on college visits to schools you might find interesting, do so.\n\n* Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also wander around.\n* Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear?\n* Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night. Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospective student and, even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Move on and find a kinder person.\n* Check out the dining hall and the gym.\n* Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one. Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable.\n* If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get a feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.\n\nVIRTUAL VISITS: Most colleges have really upped their game when it comes to virtual tours, online info sessions, and their social media presence, so be sure to check out all the ways they are bringing their college to you on their websites.\n\nCOLLEGE LIST: Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but you can also learn a lot on the internet, social media, and by reading books. Besides virtual and live tours and info sessions, you can learn more about colleges here:\n\n* Reddit: here on r/ApplyingToCollege, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.\n* Colleges’ websites. Sign up to receive info and get on their mailing lists.\n* Common Data Set. Google “college name” and “common data set”\n* Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on Instagram, and Twitter, and TikTok.

See below\n\nSOMETHING TO CONSIDER: Your SureFire Sure Bet Welcoming School -- Make sure you have at least one Sure-Fire Sure Bet Welcoming School and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity. A sure-fire safety school is a school:\n\n* where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions\n* AND you would like to go there\n* AND they are a financial safety\n* Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure-fire safety until you have already been admitted.\n\nI like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety out of the way. You must LOVE your safety. Research it and imagine yourself there. Remember the strength of your application is only as strong as your list. An unbalanced list is weak and will usually not be strong enough to hold up your college admissions experience.\n\nCOLLEGE FIT: Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big old list. Having a ton of schools on this initial list is ok. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter some of the schools out. Here’s the [link to my Step By Step Guide to Creating your List](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/whq4tn/seniors_two_posts_in_one_1_if_youre_feeling_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that goes into much more detail about finding colleges that fit you. [Check out this post filled with various college lists for you to explore.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pG1biX7AjKd3YH9LtSvdHg7jMW2zCBwE?usp=sharing)\n\nADMISSIONSMOM'S COLLEGE BOOK CLUB: (I don’t actually have a book club, but I wish I did. These are just a list of books you should read.) Here are a few of the books I recommend: *College Match* by Steve Antonoff, *The Fiske Guide*, *Colleges that Change Lives*, *Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be* by Frank Bruni, and, of course, [Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit, 2023 Updates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OB7agF8xFavMGxZ-nVrQKhAXh6yLh8Bp/view?usp=sharing) by me - (this is a link to the pdf for free, but you can also buy it at your fave booksellers if you want to hold it in your hands or read it on your kindle!).\n\nCOLLEGE RESEARCH SPREADSHEET: Include info like test score averages, requirements, distance from home, school size, programs that might interest you, climate, and anything else you feel might be important.\n\nNO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE OR TIME: Make a No College-Talk Zone or Time in your house. In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it. For other families I know, it might be all day on Sundays. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year. Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your home for the next year. That’s not healthy for any of you.\n\nNET PRICE CALCULATORS: Sit down with your parents and do the net price calculators for a few colleges on your list. Begin those tough financial conversations. Be sure to use the one provided on the college page itself. You can usually find it pretty easily by googling: “College Name Net Price Calculator).\n\nNEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS: Make a new college-only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! I recommend this because then all your info from colleges won’t get mixed up in your other emails. Also, colleges prefer to see a college email address so they can know you’ll still have it after school is out. Only use this email address for colleges you’re applying to (or considering applying to) and your Application Platforms like Common App or UC Apps. I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to this email address if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes, so you don't miss important info! [Be sure you’ve signed up for “more info” or to “request info” on the college’s websites with your new college email address,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing)\n\nCHECK-IN WITH YOUR SCHOOL/COLLEGE COUNSELOR: They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have its own processes you need to follow.\n\nCOLLEGE INFO SESSIONS: If a college comes to your town or close to your town or school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in. Also, be sure to check out all the amazing virtual opportunities.\n\nCOLLEGE FAIRS: Go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.\n\nWRITE: I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what? It’s not! Even the most timid of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early. I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.\n\n* Write Every Day. Even if it’s just a sentence or two.\n* Read and listen to essays on [This I Believe](https://www.thisibelieve.org/). These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects. I like that they aren't college essays.\n* Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on Reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you.\n* Avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays, and often when you read those, you can get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive, boring essays for the reader.\n* Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources.\n\nREAD BOOKS: Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes. Reading good fiction and also self-help books will help you learn to discover your voice. Here’s a list of fantastic books to read. Some are just for fun, and others help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing, and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays. [Here's a great post by](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nwij3j/books_to_read_that_mention_the_college_admissions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [u/SplendidCheese](https://www.reddit.com/u/SplendidCheese/), where they highlight some fun fiction books about college admissions. I've included a few in my list here, too.\n\n* *Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics* by Dan Harris and Jeff Warren\n   * *The Happiness Equation* by Neil Pasricha\n   * *You are a Badass* by Jenn Sincero\n   * *Brave Enough, Wild,* and *Tiny Beautiful Things* \\-- all by Cheryl Strayed\n   * *The Soul of an Octopus* (just finished it and loved it!)\n   * *Me and Earl and the Dying Girl* by Jesse Andrews ( I like his voice and it’s on a lot of banned book lists!.)\n   * *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig\n   * *Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow* by Gabrielle Zevin\n   * *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir\n   * *Lessons in Chemistry* by Bonnie Garmus\n   * Some fun fiction books about College Admissions:\n      * *This is Not a Personal Statemen*t by Tracy Badua\n      * *The Ivies* by Alexa Donne -- A2C gets a shout-out!\n      * *Girls with Bright Futures* by Tracy Dobmeier and Wendy Katzman\n\n* *Admission* by Julie Buxbaum\n\n* *Where the Grass is Green and The Girls are Pretty* by Lauren Weisberger\n\nTAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER: Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key. There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad. So, how do you deal with it? What do you do -- besides post and comment on a2c??? :))\n\n* [You are a BadAss College Applicant:](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/2024-college-admissions-decisions-wind-and-a-little-stress?r=3qhdg3) A post with a metaphor about baby trees and college stress.\n* [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n* Be involved. And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.\n* LEAN IN. Lean into your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress. Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it. Instead, face it and embrace it. If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience is so much about the journey and not the outcome. And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a particular school.\n* Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air. Eat Healthy Food\n\nOTHER… If you qualify, explore these amazing programs and possible options if you’re not already:\n\n* QuestBridge Program: [https://www.questbridge.org/](https://www.questbridge.org/)\n* Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program:[ http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/](https://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/)\n* The Posse Foundation: [https://www.possefoundation.org/](https://www.possefoundation.org/)\n\nJuniors, you are in for the journey of your lives. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible. Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming. Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger. I'm looking forward to watching your transformations! This is a prime opportunity for you to take advantage of digging in and getting to know who you are.\n\n# Rising Senior Summer\n\nThis is an important summer for you, but there is no magical formula of what you need to or have to do to get into any colleges-- even the most highly selective ones. Sure, you can research in a lab, get an internship, or do a program somewhere on campus or around the world. Those are all fantastic ways to spend your summer. You can also do independent projects – and I think you should – even in addition to whatever else you might be doing.\n\nBut, don’t forget the good old-fashioned summer job. You can actually stand out from the applicant crowd these days by making a smoothie, flipping a burger, or scooping ice cream. These kinds of jobs allow you to learn about taking care of others and listening to what the customer wants, learn about organizing your thoughts and activities, learn to work with others, and gain some experiences you might never have the chance to gain again.\n\nHere’s what William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Harvard Admissions, has said about summer: “Bring summer back... Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e., to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead.”\n\nFINISH TESTING: SAT and ACT (if possible)\n\nRECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES: Take time to care for your mental health and your body. Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Breathe. \n\nCOLLEGE-ONLY EMAIL ADDRESS: If you haven’t yet, be sure to make a college-only email address that you use for your applications and communications with colleges. See above in JUNIOR SPRING for a longer explanation.\n\nWRITE: “Write like a motherf\\*cker,” as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself. Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. See my WRITE from Junior Spring.\n\n[Here’s a list of questions to get you going](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LviZQkEwVd6_SY4-XlCMRpVRiCDL_rdC/view?usp=sharing). This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1. Check out [themostdangerouswritingapp.com](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app). Start asking yourself some hard and kinda silly questions. I’ve had students write stunning essays just by answering these questions:\n\n* What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?\n* What do you worry about?\n* What’s your secret sauce?\n* What’s your superpower?\n* When you’re in your room at night, what do you look at?\n* What makes you smile?\n\nTHINK ABOUT AND PRACTICE WRITING THE PERSONAL ESSAY: Remember — no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message — the topic is YOU. Focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are. Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader. You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value. They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application. Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources.\n\nMAKE A COMMON APP/COALITION ACCOUNT & any other accounts you might need: Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background. Those roll over when they update the website in August. DO NOT fill out college-specific info. It could be lost. Write your essays in a google doc. Do not write them in the app!\n\nUPDATE YOUR RESUME: Or create it if you haven’t done so yet. [Here’s a sample I use.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MaObJv_8g3lIGj_80n97Wg36MVib2RaiLX8g3f76rc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nVISIT COLLEGES if you can: See information about College Visits and Virtual Visits in the Junior Spring section.\n\nSTART YOUR COLLEGE LIST: [Here’s a post about creating your college list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/whq4tn/seniors_two_posts_in_one_1_if_youre_feeling_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[.](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/my-2024-guide-to-building-the-best-college-list?r=3qhdg3) Start narrowing down your list — including a wide range of selectivities. Make sure you have at least three SFSB Welcoming Schools. What is a SureFire SureBet Welcoming School you ask? Well, it’s often your most important school. It’s one:\n\n* Where you have direct/auto/guaranteed admissions based on your stats\n* OR you’ve already been admitted via ED, EA, or Rolling\n* AND you can see yourself being happy there\n* AND it works financially for you and your family.\n\nREALITY CHECKS: You hear me say time and time -- time again -- that you cannot expect to be accepted to the most highly rejective colleges in the country -- no matter how brilliant your application and shiny and sparkly your essays and ECs and LORs are. I’m not saying don’t apply -- Do apply. Clearly, some of you will get in and I’m here for that. I’m just saying there are too many amazing yous out there, so you absolutely can not expect it. You’re a brilliant generation -- and now you’re gonna have to figure out a way to share your brilliance in ways beyond a tiny teacup of colleges that a defunct magazine ranks in order to stay relevant.\n\nKEEP IN TOUCH WITH COLLEGES: [Sign up to \"request info\" from every college you’re interested in](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing) — even if you’re already getting info from them because they bought it from a testing company. Use your college-admissions-only email address for this. Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Instagram and Twitter for the colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following Common App, too. Also, it’s ok to occasionally contact your regional college admissions officers or the general admissions office with questions.\n\n# Senior Fall\n\nAll of the above....plus:\n\nFinish up any college visits (or virtual visits) especially for EARLY DECISION POSSIBILITIES.\n\nCOLLEGE LIST: Begin to narrow your college list. [Make sure your list is balanced](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vuing4/its_all_about_finding_your_balanced_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and you have three SureFire SureBet Welcoming Schools (see above) that you love and that will be good financial fits, as well as a collection of matches, reaches, and lotteries (if that’s your thing). \n\nDEMONSTRATED INTEREST: Check the Common Data set to see whether the colleges on your list consider demonstrated interest. If they do, make sure you open and read every email they send you, click on links they send you, and spend some time researching on their websites. Also, go to webinars, campus visits if you can, virtual visits, and reach out to admissions with any questions you have.\n\nCOLLEGE APPLICATION SPREADSHEET: Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics — and look for overlap. Testing info.\n\nFILLING OUT APPLICATIONS: Start with the details if you didn't do it in the summer. Fill out activities, family history, etc.\n\nEARLY ACTION: Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available and that you can by following guidelines. Make a calendar of deadlines and essay requirements and work through them one by one.\n\nFAFSA AND CSS: Make accounts and start gathering and filling out information.\n\nFINANCIAL AID: Reach out to the financial aid offices of schools on your list and establish a relationship with them. Do the net price calculators on the college websites with your parents.\n\nLETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and \"cheat sheet\" if you haven't yet.)[ See linked LOR Post for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nYOUR SCHOOL COUNSELOR: Check in with your school counselor. They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have its own processes that you need to follow.\n\nSAT/ACT TESTS: Finish up any testing you have left to do. Be sure to check colleges’ websites for their last accepted testing dates.\n\nSUBMIT TEST SCORES: Submit your test scores in plenty of time for deadlines to the schools that don't allow self-report. Be sure to check the colleges’ admissions websites to find when they need to be submitted and whether they allow self-reporting or not. And for colleges that are test-optional, do your research to figure out whether you should or should not report. You can use the Common Data Set to see where your scores fit in. Use [www.fairtest.org](https://www.fairtest.org/) to find out whether a college is test-optional or not. [Here’s a link to my copy/paste I share with students when they ask about submitting scores.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnzg3Kc6cP08XxpYi6Slpjh-YhLIeqDHLNZK09z9WBM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAP SCORES: I suggest self-reporting AP scores of 4s and 5s and sometimes 3s. [Here’s my post about APs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ug130e/lets_talk_about_ap_tests_and_scores/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nESSAYS: Start writing your essays for real now. Focus first on your Personal Statement. Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources. Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates. [Here’s my post about Making Peace with the Supplemental Essays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xdbil5/making_your_peace_with_the_supplemental_essays/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). How many [“Why College” Essays](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14mevoYJi-mzDBiDOCqh4Sotiu_Bjz5mOpy7_Hc3zhQ0/edit?usp=sharing) do you have? When's the first one due? Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the Extracurricular Essays. Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1. Use an app organizer for this.\n\nINTERVIEWS: Be sure to check your email (and voicemail and trash and spam folders for interview invitations). Every school has a different method for signing up, so read their websites carefully. For some, you are automatically signed up when you apply. Others require you to sign up yourself or to apply by a certain deadline. In most cases, they are optional, and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity. I do suggest that you do them though if they are available to you — even if they’re optional and you’re nervous. Lean into your fear, admit it to them if you want, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go. [My Interview Post is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qotxxj/your_step_by_step_guide_to_interviews_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nEMOTIONAL PLANNING: If you applied early, prepare yourself for decisions that might not go your way. [My Post about Emotional Planning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nLOCI: If you are deferred Early Decision, be sure to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest) if you are still interested in attending that college. [Here’s a post about that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rz2tz4/so_you_were_deferred_what_to_do_now_its_time_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# Senior Spring\n\nThis post got too long, so I’ll talk about senior spring when we get closer!\n\ntl;dr\n\n* Junior year is when the college admissions prep really kicks in -- you got this.\n* Follow this guide while adapting it to suit your own needs\n* Check with your high school counselor.\n* Be involved. Figure out what makes you happy and interested, and do it.\n* Take hard courses.\n* Make good grades.\n* Don’t lose sight of keeping your balance and keeping yourself mentally, intellectually, physically, and emotionally healthy.\n* Honestly, I don't really know how to tl;dr this one.

    "body": "For some context, I’m a mature student (27) who started uni last September. I moved into halls and met some amazing friends, something I didn’t think I’d even do. After being in a toxic relationship for 10 years I’d isolated myself a lot and didn’t really have many friends in my home city, so being able to get on well with so many people was honestly so refreshing! I felt super lucky to be placed with decent flatmates, especially after reading some horror stories. I love my course and my coursemates and tutors are the most down to earth people I’ve ever met. It honestly felt too good to be true, but I’d began a totally new life, which I felt I really needed after a shitty past. \n\nHowever, it’s the run up to second year and things have gone so, so downhill. I’d met a new guy after my breakup and before coming to uni, we did so much and spent lots of time together, even when I was at uni we were in constant communication and maintained a medium distance relationship. After 2 and a half years, he decided to end things with me at the end of last year, which completely broke my heart and set me back so far. When I eventually felt somewhat healed, my nan had a really bad fall in April causing her to pass away which sent me into a depressive spiral. Not only had I lost someone I was closer to than my parents, but I’d also lost my home because I lived with her outside of term time. Her house has now been repossessed by the council, and soon enough someone else will be living there.\n\nMy friends were the only ones there for me to get me through all of this, especially my flatmates. I honestly thought I was so lucky. But yet again I was dealt another blow; I’ve just recently found out that my flatmate is in a relationship with my ex, the same one who she comforted me over when I was crying. She’s been lying to me about it for god knows how long. We weren’t just flatmates who’d occasionally say hello every now and then, we were really close friends who would do loads together and felt like we could relate to each other. If I went into detail on this I’d be here all day, all I can say is I feel betrayed, hurt and beaten down. \n\nAfter everything that’s happened, my university experience has gone from feeling like everything I ever wanted, to like it’s the worst thing to happen. I have to live in a flat with the girl who’s now in a relationship with my ex, I can’t find a job so I spend everyday feeling lonely whilst my remaining friends have jobs and lives to live, uni is done til September, most people have gone home for summer, my campus is really small and there are no societies or anything to do to meet new people or get myself out of my room. I can’t even go home because I don’t have a home to go back to anymore. \n\nThe truth is, I don’t even know what I want this post to even achieve. I just feel so alone and lost, with a constant feeling of anxiety in my stomach. How the hell do I get myself through this without dropping out and disappearing completely? 😂\n\nEDIT: wow, never realised how many people on this subreddit were so bitter and rude 😂 I know my situation may seem minor to some, but it’s still hurt me all the same. No point in complaining any further because I chose to post on a public forum where anyone can comment, I just didn’t expect so much bitterness from asking for a little advice lol \n\nEDIT 2: thank you to those who gave me genuine and straight advice and those who reached out over messages 🥰"

For context, most people in our universities commute instead of living on campus and as such it is much less active.\n\nHowever, with the way things are looking it is getting more and more worrying to consider travelling there. There have been quite a few instances now where it has been difficult for foreigners like Australians to enter or leave the US, getting stopped and interrogated by TSA for hours - let alone the current climate inside. Would going on an exchange trip there still be reasonable?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for all the responses, seriously it’s a big help. Just want to add and address a few things:\n\n1. I feel like the fact that there is this much disagreement in the comments regarding safety is already quite telling - I know that the media is not everything but facts still remain, and something as recent as Trump’s bill can potentially affect me as much as whatever else he might do in the next few years. \n\n2. I am ethnically Southeast Asian.\n\n3. Yes I know college in the movies is not real life, but I still plan on going exchange no matter what and the US was just my first preference. I currently live with my parents, and commute a total of three hours every day I choose to go to campus. Evening-night events are scarce as people have to travel home. The “experience” I am looking for will largely come from moving out and going on exchange at all, and less from America specifically - however it is undeniable that some stuff I definitely can’t experience here, such as the huge college sports scene that for us just doesn’t exist."

I'm never thought I'd be able to have an education, to have the opportunity of advancing my life, to be in a community of like minded people, of anything, and I am proud of being able to make it this far. I really am. You should be proud too.\n\nI'm investing my time into my future. I spent the two years at community college with a high gpa after having been completely nothing during high school. I worked shitty jobs, I took care of my grandma, and now I'm going to a university, just a month away.\n\nI am so fucking excited. I'm gonna be living in a rooming house with 5 other people right next to campus but I don't care. I'm ready to be there, in person, becoming my best self. It's just a state school (go huskies!!!!) but it just means so much to me. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. This is what my parents wanted of me. I'm making them happy going into electrical engineering. I'm making myself happy, too. I grew up pretty poor, and my siblings all have low paying jobs (no judgement, it's hard to do otherwise) but I can see the path to something brighter... And it's just makes me so happy.\n\nNo debt (so far, this year though the expenses really start) and an associates right now. I felt so good walking up on stage and getting that degree. Everybody in my family was there looking at me with joy. But I'm not done yet. But I'm just so happy to have been able to do this.\n\nEveryone here who is going to college, good job making it however far you have. Be happy you get this experience, don't take it for granted. Putting in any effort is better than none."

    "body": "\\*For context, I'm a sophomore in college, and I got rejected from my dream school 2 years ago. I don't really interact with sub often, but I wrote this comment on someone else's rejection post and I hope other current seniors can benefit from reading it. Seeing your guys' rejection posts always gets me in my feels, but I just wanted to let you guys know that it's going to be okay!\n\nI got rejected from my dream college! I'm not going to lie, it sucked for a very long time. I couldn't stop imagining what my life would have been like at that college, and I felt like any shot I had at greatness or achieving success was gone. Seeing everyone get into their dream schools was like a stab to the heart, even though I was happy for them. I took my rejection and their success personally and believed that I wasn't as special or smart as I thought I was. Honestly (and maybe it's because I'm dramatic) it was one of the worst periods of my life.\n\nBut no, it does not haunt you for the rest of your life. I had serious contempt for my state school, and I was hellbent on not having a fun time there when I committed. The disappointment followed me to August of my freshman year of college, but it was quickly replaced by all the great opportunities on campus. Was it the 300 year old campus I had dreamed about? Most definitely not, but I laughed with friends in the library until 4 AM, went downtown to try new coffee places, cheered at football games, and so, so much more. The work ethic I had in college did not go to waste- I've made high grades every semester and I'm on track to complete a degree with two majors and a masters' degree in 5 years, with a couple of internships already under my belt. Sometimes I do scroll on Linkedin and feel inadequate, but I know where i'm at right now doesn't define where I'll be in the future. I'm back to having ambitious, big goals for myself that senior year-me couldn't fathom because she was too busy feeling dejected. I can't roam this campus without remembering what I said and did in each building, sidewalk, and corner, and this school has become fundamental to my personal growth. You know what I don't remember? The \"Thank you for applying, but...\" email, how much I cried over winter break when I got rejected, the jealousy, the loss of hope. I realized that school did not define my greatness, I did.\n\nI only came to this realization because I let myself grow and change. Sometimes the only way getting over it is through, so it is going to hurt. You're going to feel sad and compare yourself to your peers, and think you're not \"enough\" to be something in this world. But life keeps going, and this is just one event in your whole life! Give yourself a break for a couple of weeks (or months, I certainly had to) but brush yourself off, tell yourself how hardworking and smart you are until you begin to believe it again, dream big for the future, and you'll move on one day. The resilience you learn from this will help you beyond just four years of college, and qualities like that are just as important as a college education.\n\nI know this all seems very difficult right now, and your sadness compels you to not believe in my words, but from one rejectee to another: you are enough! You will be successful one day and your dream school's rejection will just be something that happened to you in senior year. You got this ❤️\n\n"

    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1hexrz9/hello_beautiful_seniors_if_early_admissions_2024/",
    "body": "Look, I know many of you are feeling stressed (or more) about decisions this week and last week. I get it — it’s a crazy tough time -- especially if you weren’t offered admission. I know it's cliche, but you really have to know this: It’s their loss. You are going to be sad for a day or two or even three, and then you’re gonna get your sh!t together and move forward.\n\n# Time to Keep Zigging\n\nIf things didn’t go the way you want, trust me when I say that it doesn’t mean you did anything wrong. It doesn’t change who you are or who you’re becoming or the amazing trajectory of your lives.\n\nIt just means you’re going to zig instead of zag. And zigging is really fricking awesome. When you zig you learn from the unexpected. Sure. It all hurts. It sucks so much, like really, really bad for some of you, and it’s ok to feel all that, but then you’re going to get back to your zig. You got this.\n\n# Dealing with Feelings\n\nWhen decisions don’t go your way, it can feel pretty sh!tty, but it’s ok to feel the pain. In fact, the only way to get past the pain is to allow it. In my family, we call it \"Going on a Bear Hunt.\" I don’t know if you know the children’s chant, but it’s about getting thrown the tall, swishy-swashy grass and the thick, oozy, gooey mud and the fast-rushing river. To me, those are metaphors for the emotions we have to pass through as we make our way through anger, sadness, and disappointment. My therapist used to call it making it through the train tunnel. You’ve got to let yourself feel those emotions, or you get stuck -- and you really need to make your way out.\n\nIn mindfulness, we use a technique called RAIN:\n\nRecognize your feelings.\n\nAccept and acknowledge that they are there.\n\nInvestigate them — what caused them, why are you feeling them\n\nNon—identify; know that they are just feelings -- and feelings come and go.\n\nYou are the observer of your feelings, but you are not your feelings. Think of it like this: You are the sky. Everything else is just the weather. Those feelings -- as horrible as they might be -- are like really bad weather. They will come and go. They are not you.\n\nThis is all to say, you’re going to be ok. Allow yourself to be sad or angry. Sometimes schools make really stupid f\\*cked up, stupid decisions, and it’s not a reflection on you, but that doesn’t make it easier to swallow right in the beginning. So be sad or angry. Smash some pillows, angry cry. Go through those feelings, and then go find ice cream.\n\n# Eat lots of ice cream and do some intense pillow-bashing\n\nSeniors come back and tell me this every year: After they’ve cried, pounded their pillows, licked their wounds, and eaten ice cream — and I mean there’s a lot of ice cream eating going on during college-admission-decision time — a few months later, they come back and talk about how even though it was the most stressful experience of their short lives, they are proud of how much they learned about themselves and how much stronger they feel now. This is the good kind of stress -- where you grow and learn.\n\nNow, in case you think I’m trying to turn the admissions experience into some happy-ending forest-like fairytale — I’m not. In fact, I think there’s a lot wrong with it. I believe the non-stop college talk in schools and homes is downright dangerous for some kids — and the constant college admissions chatter causes unnecessary stress in many others.\n\n# Forget about Dream Schools\n\nInstead of spending so much time focusing on one school — a “dream school,” you'll find that I'm constantly encouraging students to find “Dream You” -- not Dream U. Look, I know you’ve been taught to “dream big” and “follow your dreams,” but it’s not about finding the school of your dreams; it’s about finding the YOU of your dreams. Looking for places where you can find the best version of you, rather than the best ranking. When you’re drooling over that perfect school with a perfect campus and perfect classes, you’re not dreaming about any one school. You’re dreaming about who you want to be and where you can become who you want to be, and there isn’t only one Dream School where you can do that. So, I invite you to think deeply — and figure out what it is about that particular school that makes you consider it your dream school — because I guarantee that your dream isn’t out there in the form of a college; it is in YOU.\n\n# You can only control your own actions\n\nProbably the most relevant lesson to the college admissions journey is the understanding that we can only control our own actions — and it’s fruitless to spend our time and energy trying to control anything else. And what you can control in college admissions is what goes in the application — essays, activity descriptions, and grades and test scores to a limited extent. What you cannot control is the number of other well-qualified exceptional students who might be applying to the same tiny teacup of schools as you are; you cannot control the bulk of your transcript by the time you’re a senior; you cannot control the institutional needs of the colleges on your list; you cannot control the mood, preferences, or predilections of the application readers. You cannot, in essence, control what colleges want at the particular reading of your application on a particular day, and as an admissions officer from U Chicago once told me, “Just when you think you’ve figured out what we want, we’ve changed our mind.” The only thing you can control is becoming who you are and then putting together the best application that reflects the best of who you are.\n\n# Institutional priorities? What does that mean?\n\nI've been asked before what \"institutional priorities\" means: it means colleges have to create a class, so they’re looking for all kinds of people with varying strengths, abilities, talents, and backgrounds. They don’t want to have a uniform set of people who are all doing the same stuff. That’s why it’s important to have holistic admissions and not just base it on stats. Also, they have a school to run, so certain departments and faculty might have more needs at different times. Or, sometimes, it's just whatever their board members and presidents tell them they should keep in mind as they create a class. This is the part of college admissions we have no control over and why applicants need not take any of it personally. Institutional needs change year to year, so you can’t prep and plan ahead.\n\n[Here’s a comment by one of our former moderators on r/ApplyingToCollege on Reddit that I think explains a lot about institutional priorities.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustinAdmissions2/comments/rdqpm4/where_is_utaustins_first_admissions_wave_sharing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n# 🧘🏻‍♀️ Remember to Breathe\n\nWhen I’m feeling overwhelmed by sadness and frustration, I try to remind myself to stop and breathe and say these words:\n\nI am who I am\n\nThis is what it is\n\nMay I accept things as they are\n\nMay I trust in the unfolding\n\nIt’s so simple to breathe, yet when we are full-on in the anger and sadness and worry feels, it can be crazy difficult task to remember. And these words can help you with the reality that there is only so much you can control. Right now, what you can control is how you process this time in your life and next steps.\n\n# Now, here’s what I love most about college admissions\n\nIt can actually be this period of amazing self-growth and development — like no other if you allow yourself to recognize that some amount of stress is necessary and good for your development, and if we acknowledge that there might be ways to reframe our understanding of college admissions by changing the words and phrases we use. When you take control of your admissions journey, and you incorporate some mindfulness into your lives, you can grow in self-confidence and maturity as you dig in and learn more about yourself than you ever have. Figuring out what you want in a college, developing a list, and writing personal essays all require deep reflection and self-investigation. Taking the reins and handling the details and difficulties of the application process demonstrates your abilities and strengths. And, no matter the outcome, no matter where you end up going to college, no matter how painful some of this journey might be, this transformational experience, filled not only with stress but also with excitement and joy — is turning you into a stronger human, ready to take on college — and life.\n\n**One last note:** It can really hurt when life doesn’t go your way, and sometimes you just have to give in to the pain — that’s the only way through it. So slam doors, eat ice cream -- or chips, bash pillows, cry — it’s all ok. It’s their loss. You are going to be sad for a day or two, and then you’re going to get your sh!t together and \"thank-you-next\" them so you can recognize this: this one door shutting? It’s really an infinite number of doors opening. This is your chance. This is your time to learn how strong you are and learn more about colleges and what you want for yourself. This isn’t an ending. It’s a beginning.\n\n**Deferred?** For those of you who were deferred, we’ll discuss writing a LOCI in January. Do whatever the college says to do in the paperwork, sign forms, etc. But if you’re planning to write a Letter of Continued Interest (LOCI), I suggest you do that in January after colleges are back on campus if they don’t give you other more explicit directions. I’ll be making a new post in early January, but here’s my post from last year, [if you’d like to learn more:](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/if-you-were-deferred-its-time-to)\n\n# Tl;dr: You are a badass. You don’t need them. You have you.\n\n\n\nWhen life gives you lemons, lean back and squeeze that shit into your eyeballs. Then glare back at life and say, \"That all you got, motherf\\*cker?\" -- Mark Manson\n\n(and don't do that -- it will hurt a lot!!!)\n\n# Just for Parents of Students Applying to College:\n\nI know (from personal experience) that these can be rough days for parenting – dealing with the stress of waiting for decisions is hard for everyone involved, and when decisions don’t go your child’s way and they are hurt, you hurt too. But please keep in perspective that this is *their* experience, and they will need to process and go through it in their own way.\n\nRemember you are the support system here. Just as the decisions that colleges make are in no way a reflection of who your child is, those decisions are also in no way a reflection of your parenting.\n\nHowever, you do have the opportunity to do some awesome parenting right now.\n\nBe sure to tell your kids how proud you are of them – before and after decisions come out.\n\nBe sure to tell them that *where* they attend college is not what matters to you.\n\nBe sure they know that you know they will be successful in life, and the name of their college won’t be what creates that success.\n\nToo many kids these days aren’t hearing these messages from their parents, so make sure yours do – Please.\n\nAlso, make sure you have lots of ice cream or chips and guacamole or whatever their favorite treat is on hand! Believe it or not, hugs and ice cream can make a big difference.\n\nXOXO AdmissionsMom\n\n"

    "body": "1.) **Keep your options open.** As someone who decided to only apply to schools which had my specific major, I ended up deciding it wasn't for me career-wise and was screwed. Apply to similar programs at other schools and actually research schools. Apply to around 15 schools (maybe 15-20 but that's it). \n\n2.) Actually **research and apply to schools who have your specific needs/priorities** and don't just apply because \"the name of the school sounds good.\" Prestige won't make you happy in the long-run. You won't actually want to go there and it's a waste of time and money to apply, so research the schools, find out what you like and don't like, and curate a list on schools you would actually go to if you got in. \n\n3.) Ask teachers for **letter of rec's** middle of junior year bc a lot of teachers put a cap on how many they'll do. ALSO, pick teachers who you've had a good connection with and a recent class. If you had them sophomore and junior year, great. If you had them freshman year they haven't seen you progress so don't do it. ALSO- I regret asking for a LOR from my junior year teacher bc she didn't know me too well and had over a 100 she was doing, so her's wasn't very specific and didn't highlight me the way I wanted.\n\n2.) **You won't actually know what type of college campus you want until you visit it.** I thought I wanted to go somewhere cold, next to a lake/near nature, on the outskirts or a large city, out-of-state, and big victorian architecture. I ended up going to a place the complete opposite and loved it. \n\n3.) **Don't overload yourself with AP/honors** courses and extracurriculars **senior year**. I decided to take 5 AP classes on top of 25 hours of part-time work and a million different extracurriculars. You just gotta survive senior year, don't add more stress to your life by deciding to take a million classes. It won't help you. \n\n4.) **Focus on yourself and don't get jealous.** People who you don't think tried as hard as you will be going to better schools than you. People who you think tried super hard will also be going to \"better schools.\" People who partied more, studied more, tried harder, might also end up at the same school as you. You might feel jealous that your friend is going to Harvard or Julliard and you're not (from experience), or that your friend who tried way less ended up at the same school as you---but this isn't about them, it's about you. **Don't get caught up in everybody else's life plans** when you need to focus on letting yours grow. \n\n5.) You might regret not doing more these past 4 years. You might regret not partying, partying, ending up in the wrong crowd, not enjoying/taking advantage of these part 4 years, or feeling guilty for focusing too much on social and not enough academics. You're not going to be fully satisfied with how you're ending your high school career. **There's always something you could've done \"better,\"** but at the end of the day it doesn't matter. Reflect on this and take advantage of what life has to offer in college. \n\n6.) **It's okay to not have had everything figured out** in high school, just be glad you're doing this now instead of later. \n\n7.) **You're never going to see 90% of your friends again.** Don't decide to go to college where your friend/gf/bf/family is going, go somewhere that fits you. \n\n8.) **You don't need to go to a T20 school to be successful.** I'm going to a cal state school and it fits me. Go somewhere with resources/opportunities for you, works in your finances, and fits your needs. \n\n9.) **You'll know when you find your college.** It's okay to be intimidated on a college campus, but you should also feel excited. If you feel too much out-of-place and don't think the students there match your energy, that college might not be right for you. I have a friend who chose Cal Poly SLO over Duke because he couldn't see himself at Duke and the people were so different from him. **Just bc the school's name is better, doesn't mean that college is better for you. Besides for UCLA and UCB, I got into every UC. I turned them all down for Cal Poly SLO bc I loved the school.** \n\n10.) **Start college essays during the summer.** I was 80% done with my college apps by August. THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SUBMIT EVERYTHING SUPER EARLY. Please spend time adjusting your application unless it's rolling and needed bc you have time, but it's so easy to get caught up in all of your school work/extra stuff to avoid college apps. Finish a lot of the grunt work during the summer when Common App opens up and continue revising throughout the year. I made the mistake of submitting everything mid-October. Did I feel better? Yes. But did I regret some of my essay choices to certain schools bc of it? Yes. \n\n11.) **Colleges like unique essays. Be specific.** For example, I did a lot of slam poetry and broadcasting/filming. Colleges loved these. I also got into UCSD, UCI, and UCSB talking about working at Trader Joe's and how all of my friends were on instagram bc they were retired vets and 80 year olds in the neighborhood and how we passed each other notes. Specific, unique essays go a long way. \n\n12.) **Really really communicate with your counselor so she turns in all of your forms in on time.** It's easy for them to forget and not do it, and it'll really screw you over so make sure they stay on top of it and get written confirmation from them. If you have a meeting, send a follow up email for written proof and verification that they'll do what they say. "

It's so difficult to make friends that have shared interests because people are either way too nerdy or not nerdy at all, and there aren't enough students for me to find my little niche group. I look at all my friends from sixth form and they're at big unis (Nottingham, York, Edinburgh) where I'm stuck in some tiny university with a campus one square metre big and everyone knows everyone. It used to be a polytechnic so it isn't even a uni of. \nI hate it so much I would've transferred if I hadn't signed a rental agreement on a house with friends who I'm not even that close with.

    "body": "Hi everyone. I occasionally doomscroll through this subreddit, and a lot of the time when I see people talking about public schools, engineering schools, CS programs, etc., I feel like UDub is almost never mentioned — or at the very least not given the recognition it deserves. When people discuss the “Top 10 Public Schools,” schools like UIUC and UW-Maddison are not only ranked higher than UDub, but UDub is excluded from the conversation altogether. I know reddit, especially r/A2C, is not a reliable source to gauge public opinion, but it makes me sad because I feel like it is so over hated. \n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings\n\nhttps://www.washington.edu/news/2024/10/09/uw-ranks-among-best-in-the-world-fourth-among-us-public-institutions/#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20Washington%20is,and%20the%20University%20of%20Michigan.\n\nObjectively, UDub is the #1 University in the Pacific Northwest, T10 for public universities, #7 for CS (above CalTech, Columbia, UPenn, etc.), T20 in both business and engineering, with strong programs in education, english, linguistics, pre-med, and social work. On top of this, it is a feeder into tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft, as well as all other Seattle-based companies like Boeing, Nordstrom, etc. And also, it is in the top 10 most recruited schools into Silicon Valley, San Francisco, and the Bay Area. On the West Coast it is also very known and respected. AND, even after all of that, it has one of the most beautiful campuses in the world, with a prime location right outside of Seattle; the perfect balance of an urban city and surrounding nature. Student life, school spirit, D1 athletics, academic rigor, and a great location all in one. \n\nI am aware of its cons, of course; people always complain about the weather. But seriously, can people handle terrible snow in Michigan/Wisconsin and not handle gloomy skies with very little snow? IMO, autumn, spring, and summer all make the dreary winter weather absolutely tolerable. People also complain about Seattle in general, saying there’s too much homelessness and whatnot, but I feel like this isn’t a fair comparison since this is an issue in every major city. You don’t see people telling others to not apply to Berkeley because of the homelessness issue (of course Berkeley is in a league of its own, but my point still stands). And while capacity constrained majors are certainly an issue, I think people should still apply and try to get DA to their desired major (plus, only a handful of majors have to seriously deal with this). \n\n IDK, I feel like I’m going crazy. Why does nobody care about such a fantastic school? "

    "body": "Wow, this is exciting!  You just got the glossy mailer inviting you to apply to a *very prestigious* summer camp!  And it will be held at an Ivy!  With real, live Ivy ^(affiliated) professors teaching it!  Surely if you can somehow scrape together the low five figures they're asking for, this will all but cement your admission to that same school or other T20s come senior year...right?\n\nThe no-longer-secret truth about these programs is that they won't really help your application to a top 20 college.  And that's good news for most of us.  Quite often, the selection criteria for these programs is primarily (or even totally) driven by your ability to pay for them - I've taken to calling them **\"Summer Paygrams.\"**  They admit the vast majority of applicants, and do not typically offer opportunities and experiences that admissions offices will regard as distinctive or compelling.  It's quite possible for your parents to sign you up for one of these, and for you to go through the motions doing the bare minimum as a warm body in the room.  There may be no initiative, leadership, or even effort or engagement on your part.  And for some students, that's part of the draw - they get something they think looks good on their resume without much work or thoughtful planning, and it's a lot easier than blazing your own trail.  At the end of the day, there's very little impact to your college application, which is in direct contradiction to the biggest reason I've seen students and parents interested in these.  If you're a very strong applicant to top colleges, then attending a summer paygram probably won't hold you back.  If you're not a strong applicant, a summer paygram probably won't make you into one.\n\n#Pros and Cons of Summer Paygrams\n\n**Pros**\n- It's all planned for you.  So you don't have a litany of decisions to make or accountabilities to hold yourself to.  You can relax and enjoy the structured program.\n- Exploration.  You'll get a chance to see a college campus, dive into some classes and activities related to the topic/theme of the camp, and meet some interesting people.\n- It's better than bingeing Netflix or playing video games in your mom's basement all summer.\n\n**Cons**\n- It's all planned for you.  And admissions officers know that you didn't really achieve much - you mostly just showed up. \n- Opportunity cost.  You often can't take on as many other opportunities with your summer, so you need to think carefully about whether this is on your list of things you really want to do.\n- Financial cost. Many of these are crazy expensive - I've seen some over $20K+.\n\n#The Difference Between Quality Programs And Cash-Grab Paygrams\n\n>*\"How do I find the good summer programs that are actually worthwhile and will actually help make my college applications stronger?*\n\nAt the bottom of this post, I've listed out many of the best summer programs and very high quality options.  I have a similar set of criteria for evaluating programs as MIT does, and these are a good way to assess any program's value, especially from a college admissions perspective.  There are many excellent programs that will not manage to fully meet all of these factors.  But these are the best criteria for assessing quality and value.   The best ones are:\n\n- **Free** - The best programs are free or offer generous need-based financial aid.  There is a very nearly inverse relationship between the cost of a program and the value it brings to your college application.  Many of the best programs will even offer stipends to cover incidental expenses.  Note that a program does not *have* to be free to be high quality, but if an expensive program doesn't offer need-based aid, that's usually a strong indication that it's a paygram.\n\n- **Selective** - Programs admitting more than 80% of their applicants tend to be significantly less valuable that those with admit rates below 20%.  These rates are not often published, but many programs will have some indication of selectivity, or they will have limiting eligibility requirements.\n\n- **Intellectually Compelling** - You should learn meaningful content, find your curiosity or inquisitiveness encouraged, and be given opportunities to explore material at a deeper level. \n\n- **Educationally Rigorous** - You should be challenged and held accountable for being fully engaged.  The best programs will mirror the rigor of undergraduate study.\n\n- **Community Driven** - They should intentionally foster a great community of like-minded peers and a student cohort that is interesting and inclusive.  Both the students and faculty should support the culture of learning & rigor, emphasis on interpersonal connection, community vibe, and communal enjoyment of sharing passion and geeking out over the subject together.  There should be opportunities to get to know other students, develop relationships, and continue discussions.  At the best programs, attendees tend to stay in touch afterward and even reconnect in college.\n\n- **Enriching** - You should walk away with a profound sense that the experience was worthwhile and that it deepened your interest and understanding of the subject matter.\n\n- **Fun** - This is your life, and you only get one.  You don't want to waste a summer slogging through something you hate or killing off any spark of interest in the topics or subjects you're exploring.  Good programs find ways to make the experience enjoyable, and most students are sad when it's over.\n\nIf you want to spot the worst programs and avoid borderline scams or costly mistakes, consider the opposite qualities to those listed above.  Programs which check too many off this list are probably not worthwhile:\n\n- **Expensive** - Little to no financial aid is offered, and the price tag is in the high four to low five figures.  Paygrams.\n\n- **Open Enrollment** - Many expensive paygrams will admit 80% or more of their applicants with some admitting anyone willing to pay.  This means enrolling some students who are unmotivated or unqualified. \n\n- **Intellectually Bland** - There are few if any opportunities for deeper engagement with the material and subject matter.  They simply push through the planned syllabus. \n\n- **Educationally Light** - The program and content are clearly catering to the lowest common denominator of admitted student, and that's not a high bar to clear.  Little to no material is presented at the college level and is instead simple and introductory.  Students' main responsibility is to show up rather than to demonstrate mastery, think critically, or apply the knowledge and skills they're learning.\n\n- **Siloed or Individualistic** - There is little community or culture to speak of.  Most students were sent by their parents and are just there to check the boxes.  Faculty are there to get through it and collect their paycheck. Opportunities for personal connection or continued discussions are limited or performative.\n\n-**Inert** - The goal is completion of the program, not a richer understanding of the subject, an engaging experience, or an enhanced skill set.\n\n- **Boring or Tedious** - The classes are dry and plodding.  Assigned exercises are geared toward regurgitating information rather than applying it in creative or innovative ways.  When the paygram finally ends, both the students and faculty are relieved.\n\n#FAQ\n\n>**How many selective summer programs should I apply to?**\n\nThis depends on how much time you have available, how competitive your application is, and how determined you are to land a spot at a good program.  Most of my strongest and most determined students apply to 8-15 programs, partially because most of the essays are substantially the same.  It also depends on how many programs you actually find interesting.\n\n>**Everyone knows these \"paygrams\" are a terrible value, especially for college admissions.  Why are you wasting time talking about this?**\n\nFirst, while it's no longer a secret, there are still hundreds of people who don't know or find out too late.  Below are some actual things parents have said to me during consultations:\n\n- \"Our daughter was admitted to a really great program this summer at Harvard, so obviously that's going to really boost her chances at Ivies.\"\n\n- \"This program sounds amazing, but not quite affordable - I just wanted your thoughts on whether it's worth financing it with a loan?\"\n\nSecond, the list of programs below will introduce many high quality options that may not be on most students' radar.  Check it out.\n\n>**\"Are the best and most selective summer programs worth applying for?  Will they actually strengthen my college application?  It seems like a lot of work.\"**\n\nThe best summer programs are absolutely worth it both because of the experience and opportunities and because top colleges recognize their value, rigor, selectivity, and distinction. There's a bit of chicken-and-egg to this because incredible students are more likely to get into top summer programs and also more likely to get into top colleges.  But the following examples of students I worked with aren't coincidental:\n\n1.  A student I worked with last year who attended SSP got into Harvard, 5 UCs (including UCLA & UC Berkeley, with Regents at 3 of them), and was offered a full ride from USC.  Her only rejection was Stanford.\n\n2.  One of our students this year who attended SSP is a finalist for multiple full ride scholarships and just got a likely letter (call) from Yale.\n\n3.  The last student we worked with who attended RSI was admitted to nine T20 colleges.\n\n4.  A few years ago we worked with a student who attended a highly selective medical research program.  Despite not being in the traditional \"top tier\" of applicants, they were admitted ED to Northwestern.\n\n5.  Our last student who attended BeaverWorks was admitted to 3 Ivies and 7 T20s.\n\n6.  Another way to consider this - every student we've ever worked with who attended one of the programs listed below was admitted to one or more T20s.  That doesn't mean these are guarantees of admissions success, but it's not nothing.\n\n>**\"HELP!  I attended or am about to attend a paygram!  How can I make it worthwhile?\"**\n\nMany paygrams are fine for what they are - they just aren't going to materially improve your college application.  Some give you real college-level coursework or have elements that fall on both sides of the list of criteria I shared above.  If you're considering a paygram, the real question is whether you value the program itself and what you'll learn there enough, and whether you'll make the most of it.  But if all you're looking for is a way to boost your college applications, there are other things that would move the needle more.\n\nYou should consider these the way colleges will consider them, namely, that the impact and depth of engagement is what matters, not the fancy-sounding name brand or the fact that you were a warm body in a chair at a summer program for a few weeks.  Even an outstanding and selective program won't move the needle much if you aren't able to demonstrate that you learned, explored, achieved, created, etc.  And even the lesser programs could still be quite worthwhile if you really apply yourself and make an impact. \n\nSo for example, if your college application lists that you went to a quality program like MIT MITES, but doesn't share any details about what you learned, accomplished, or valued, it's not going to really change their assessment of you all that much.  But on the other hand, if you go to a low-profile, for-profit, open-enrollment (non-selective) coding camp and learn Ruby on Rails, BUT then use it to build a complex and impactful mobile app for an organization you're involved in, that would be a significant accomplishment.  It would show that you have a strong work ethic, take initiative, and own your education, using your skills to make a difference.  It would show that you can take responsibility, lead practically, learn meaningful things, and apply them.  As I've said before, the impact is what matters, not the hours, brand name, \"impressiveness,\" or presentation. \n\nAs it happens, the best, most selective, and highest quality summer programs are usually the ones that also provide the best opportunities for impact.  Many of the for-profit ones are more about going through the motions, checking boxes, and looking impressive than they are about actual impact.  No matter what kind of program you attend, I think the best things to do are:\n\n**1.  Approach it intentionally.**  Don't view this as merely an opportunity to get the \"Ivy+ brand\" listed on your resume.  Don't just show up and go through the motions.  Instead, be purposeful, engaged, and focused.\n\n**2.  Think about what you want out of the program, then look for opportunities for that.**  Are you looking to network with other students or profs?  Build a particular skill set?  Learn and explore more deeply into a particular topic? \n\n**3.  Find a way to independently apply something you did or learned in the program.**  Like the example I mentioned before, if you can take something you learned and then apply it on your own in a different setting or context, that's fantastic and would show that you truly got value out of the program and made the most of it.  You might not be able to say for sure what this would be or what it would look like beforehand.  But you should ask yourself, \"after I finish this program, what are the next steps?  Where do I go from here?  How do I build on this momentum?\"\n\n**4.  Worry less about how you might present or \"spin\" something, and more about what you really want to do.**  If you're pursuing things you love because you love them, then you don't need to spin that.  You can just be honest about who you are, what you love, and what you want to pursue.\n\nTo give you an example of why the above are important, top colleges obviously want students who are high-achieving academically and have demonstrated that they are fully capable.  BUT they despise the idea of pursuing strong grades or academic accolades as a rubber stamp of approval.  They are repulsed by the idea of a student doing something just because it will look good on a college application.  They want intellectual vitality - a persistent curiosity, engagement, and pursuit of topics and fields you love, not because you think they're impressive or anything, but simply because you love them.  They want sincere passion, deep interest, and exploration & learning for its own sake.\n\n#The Best Summer Programs\n\nBelow is my list of programs which, in my opinion, are high quality and have a lot to offer, especially from a college admissions perspective.  To varying degrees, they perform well against most or all of the criteria I listed above.  Check them out and put together your own list of the ones that are the most interesting to you.  There is no order to these, and since these programs are subject to change each year, there may be some that are no longer offered or have changed in material ways.

Pretend the program is being offered by a less prestigious college, e.g. a directional state school, rather than a T20.  If Middle Tennessee State offered you a pre-college summer program for $15K, would that look as alluring as the exact same program offered by an Ivy?  Highly selective admissions offices **will not** consider where a program was held or what affiliations/brands it has.  They're evaluating these on the basis of what the actual experience is like and what they can learn about YOU, the applicant, from your experience.  Two great examples of this - among the very best and most impactful summer programs you can do are the Anson Clark Scholars Program and the Simons Summer Research Program, which are held at Texas Tech and Stony Brook.  Those are great colleges, but not especially prestigious.  But it wouldn't matter whether those programs were held at Harvard or your local community college because they fully meet all the criteria I listed above.  By the same token, a go-through-the-motions paygram at a T20 won't hold much weight no matter where it's held or who is sponsoring it because it fails all or nearly all of the criteria.\n\n#TL;DR\n\nMost pre-college summer programs aren't very valuable for college admissions, despite their prestigious locations or high price tags.  Check out my criteria and list of quality programs to make the most of your time and money. \n\nIf you think I missed something, got something wrong, or just have questions, feel free to let me know in the comments or reach out on my website at www.bettercollegeapps.com.

    "body": "*This post is part of our* ***Basic (But Really Important)*** [Admissions Definition series](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vtlu8t/how_your_academic_score_determines_what_happens/)*. All of these posts were written by our small team of former admissions officers.* \n\nCollege and university enrollment offices are under a lot of pressure to enroll the right number of students, lower their admit rate, raise their application numbers, and ensure that students graduate in four years. One major factor here is admitting students who actually want to attend. Though it is inevitable, given these institutional pressures, it does a college no good to admit a student who does not enroll. \n\nThis is why some schools track demonstrated interest.\n\n“Tracking demonstrated interest” means the college is paying attention to whether or not applicants have engaged with their school. They prioritize admitting students who have demonstrated their interest in attending. \n\nThere are several ways to demonstrate interest:\n\n* Visiting the school for a tour or open house\n* Interacting with the admission office via email\n* Participating in an admission interview\n* Speaking with a representative at a college fair or high school visit\n* Attending online information sessions\n\nAt schools that do track demonstrated interest, doing any of these shows the admission office that you, an applicant, are genuinely interested in learning about their school. They believe that students who do these things are more likely to enroll if admitted, so they are more likely to admit a student who has done one or more of these activities.\n\nAt schools that do not track demonstrated interest, these activities are not taken into account when applying. You won’t earn any extra points by doing these things, so you can focus on your application itself. Still, do your research and ideally visit the campus in person.\n\n**How do I know if a school tracks demonstrated interest?**\n\nWell, as with most things in life, you Google it. It should be pretty easy to find out. You can also peruse their Common Data Set data.\n\nOnce you have a drafted list of schools to apply to, you should figure out which schools on your list track demonstrated interest and make sure you are engaging with them in the ways they want. Remember, all of these interactions with colleges are important parts of the research you’ll need to do anyway. You just don’t want to miss out on the opportunity if a school does track demonstrated interest."

(luckily i'm transferring for Spring to a school 2 hours away, something she agreed on for my mental health)\n\ndespite going to school and living 10 minutes away from my house, my mom still continues to be very overbearing in my opinion. i am very grateful for her love and the help and support she gives me, and i don't mind having Life360 for my own safety. but here's what's happened this semester - \n\n-the second night in my dorm, my roommate had a friend in the area who called her up, saying he ordered too much Wendy's and asked if she'd like some of it. this friend lived 5 minutes away and my roommate invited me for the ride. we go to their house and leave quickly, get home around midnight and i fall asleep. there's construction near my school so Life360 says we took a \"hazardous\" drive. my mom texts me at 1:30am AFTER i fell asleep, and she makes my dad call me at 7am, waking me up\n\n-the sunday before my classes started, my mom asked if i could send her my class schedule so she could make sure i was at my dorm when i was supposed to be. i never ended up sending it\n\n-i had a lab class at 6:30pm most Thursdays that lasted about an hour. my mom didn't like this because it would start getting dark soon and i'd be \"walking home alone\". i just stopped bringing up this class to her\n\n-i was brought home on weekends, mainly because there is NOTHING to do at my dorm or the surrounding area. i'd go back on Sunday. one Sunday i asked to be brought back to school at 2pm, and i was asked WHY. maybe because i'm a college student and would like time to prepare for the week?\n\n-when i ubered one day, she asked for me to screenshot the driver and let her know when i was in the car and then at my destination, despite being able to track me. granted, she did give me money for the uber but it was an event that my parents wanted me to check out\n\n-one day, my friend ubered us to the mall. this was early october, i was very good at letting my mom know where i was going but i just figured she could track me and see i was at the mall. i get a call from my dad, clearly directed by my mom, asking me WHY i'm at the mall. then a little while later, a text from my mom asking me WHO i'm with. i can barely hang out with my friends without checking my phone constantly in case my parents try to contact me.\n\n-last month, my school had an event where the library and other buildings were open until midnight and there were little things going on. this was on a Friday night so i asked if i could go and just be brought back home on Saturday. i was asked HOW i was going to get home at midnight, that she didn't want me \"walking home\" at midnight, and asked WHY i needed to stay until midnight. my roommate drove us back at around 10pm.\n\ni seriously want to know if my mom is being too much or if i'm just being typical angsty teenager."

I just finished my second week and I have been feeling so self-conscious right now that the last time I remember feeling this awkward was when I was a 14 year-old Freshman in HS almost a decade ago.\n\nI started going to my local CC in 2021 after graduating HS that same year. I floundered and meandered through the 2+ years of being in CC. I didn't take college, my classes, and my studies seriously at all. I switched majors two or three times because I was just \"there\" at CC, and not taking it seriously, and floundered and meandered to the point where I wasn't learning any of the course material.\n\nI decided I wasn't college ready, and that I wasn't going to gain any benefit by continuing to be in college. So, then I decided to take a year off from college. I should have planned and figured out what I was going to do in that year off, but I was in a really bad place. I regret that wasting that time off from college, just like I regret wasting the 2+ years of being in CC, and I didn't do much besides stay home in that year off, doing next to nothing. I am now 22 and returning to college, with at least 2+ years left depending on whether I decide to stay with this major or major in something else. I also have zero savings, over three thousand dollars in credit card debt, and have to figure out how I am going to catch up after spending the last almost half-decade since turning 18 doing very little to advance my life, to develop myself as a person, or even making new experiences.\n\nI feel like I'm 18, but I'm 22, and now have to figure out what I need to do to catch up on the lost years between 18 and 22, while also having to navigate all of the baggage that I have accumulated in the years since turning 18.\n\nIt feels so embarrassed, awkward, and ashamed. I should have graduated in May of this year as a Class of 2025, but instead I won't be graduating until at least 2027 or later. I will also be 22 to 24+ while in college while everyone is 18-20 so I don't know how or if I will be able to engage in the campus life (clubs, parties, dorm life, etc.) because of the age gap which I really feel sad about because the CC that I went to was just another extension of HS where I didn't do anything social during my time there.\n\nI just feel so late in the game in terms of academics, social life, and where I should be in life, and too late in the game to make the best out of college. Please tell me anything that can make me feel better about this right now. I just need some advice and reassurance that it's not too late and that I'm not behind and that I'm not too old to make the most out of college life.\n\nI don't know. I don't what to feel, or how I can make myself feel better about all of this. That's why I am posting here. So that I don't have to process this alone but with others who can help me with this."

But instead I'm going to probably do nothing in my dorm room like every other evening this semester.\n\nMy goal back at auditions was any named roles (even the princess at the very beginning who flunks the test would have counted) and I prepared like crazy and even took voice lessons through the music department. Cast list comes out, turns out I'm \"Omnes\" which comes to find out was an error because the script wasn't consistent in naming characters.\n\nRegardless, I still show up thinking this could still be a good experience and I got excited that the director wanted to add a \" court band\" not in the script and I was going to be in it. Until day 2 when we started blocking and I actually found out what they wanted us to do. They wanted me and 4 other people to just stand around and make noise at certain points (which sometimes interrupted the flow of the show) and get chased around by King Sextimus. I felt very humiliated and could only think about my business professors and the university president coming to laugh at me like I haven't spent the past 4 years studying for a career in supply chain that will let me make an impact somewhere. When I signed up for the show I didn't agree to potentially lose my dignity in the process. So I had to quit.\n\nAnd because of all this, I don't even feel comfortable even going to see the show after the director thought it would be okay to make me and 4 other people the butt of a joke that honestly added nothing to the show. So now I'm bitter about my friends going to have all the fun in two weeks and I do nothing like every other weekend I'm on campus because nothing happens on the weekends. Except I don't even know what they think of me and I wonder if they think I'm a traitor for not being a \"team player\". \n\nThe worst part of this was that I postponed my graduation to do this. When I submitted paperwork last summer to add my supply chain major because I only needed a few more classes to get it, (my original major was management) my advisor offered me the option to substitute a class only offered in spring with a similar class so I could still be done in December. I'm just so ready at this point for May to arrive and graduation to happen so I can just move on with my life."

As one of the members here in our community so eloquently and appropriately put it: “Not getting into the school you want f\\*cking sucks.”\n\nHere’s the deal: The only way through the pain is to go through it.\n\nYou know, I’ve never gone through the specific pain and frustration of the application process that some of you are going through, but I’ve had my share of fucked up shitty experiences when I didn’t know where to turn, and I’ve felt a lot of awful feelings. And here’s what I’ve learned. You can’t squash those feelings. You have to accept them and let them in in order to be able to process them and move through them. So basically as backasswards if this sounds, if you’re feeling kind of shitty right now, that’s great -- because it means that you are on your way.\n\nStill, remember this: You aren’t being rejected, your application is. These results do not define your worth. Period.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nThese are just a few of the ways I've learned to deal with tough situations. I felt like today would be a good day to share them with you.\n\n**Feeling Numb?** That numbness is your body and brain protecting you from pain, but it’s ok to feel the pain. In fact, the only way to get past the pain is to go through it. Basically, what you resist, persists. So, as hard as it might be, you’re gonna have to give in to the anger and sadness, and maybe even angry cry a little and bash some pillows. Also, what works for me is listening to angry music. I’m Gen X/Boomer, so Eminem, Smashing Pumpkins, and Linkin Park are my go-tos, but you have your own, I’m sure.\n\n**Go on a Bear Hunt:** In my family, we call getting through the pain, Going on a Bear Hunt. I don’t know if you know the children’s chant, but it’s about making your way through the tall swishy swashy grass and the thick oozy gooey mud and the fast-rushing river. To me, those are metaphors for the emotions we have to pass through as we make our way through anger, sadness, and disappointment. It’s like making it through the train tunnel; if you can’t go through that darkness, you get stuck there.\n\n**The RAIN Technique:** In Mindfulness, we use the RAIN technique to help go through the emotional process of dealing with pain.\n\n**R**ecognize your feelings.\n\n**A**ccept and acknowledge that they are there.\n\n**I**nvestigate them — what caused them, why are you feeling them\n\n**N**on—identify; know that they are just feelings, and feelings come and go. You are not your feelings. You are the observer of your feelings.\n\n**You are HUMAN.** Look, having feelings is part of being human. That pain and hurt and anger you’re feeling is part of your humanity, but those feelings come and go. They are ephemeral. What feels super shitty right now is going to pass, and on the reverse side, what feels super amazing right now is also going to pass. That’s what feelings do.\n\nBut you can also, think of your feelings like this: You are the sky. Your feelings are the weather.\n\n**What Can You Control?** Probably the most relevant lesson to the college admissions journey is the understanding that we can only control our own actions. Here's what you can control — essays, activity descriptions, grades, and test scores to a limited extent.\n\n**What’s Out of Your Hands?** You cannot control the number of other well-qualified students applying to the same schools as you or the institutional needs of the colleges on your list; you cannot control the mood, preferences, or predilections of the admissions reader.\n\n**“The Two Most Important Letters in College Admissions” IP – Institutional Priorities:** Colleges are creating a class, so they’re looking for people with varying strengths, abilities, talents, and backgrounds -- not a uniform set of people who are all robotically doing the same stuff. Also, certain departments and faculty might have more needs at different times. Or sometimes, board members and presidents tell them what they should keep in mind as they create a class. This is the part of college admissions we have no control over and why applicants need to not take any of it personally. [You can read more about what Rick Clark, former Director of Admissions from Georgia Tech has to say about IPs here](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2023/03/06/the-two-most-important-letters-in-college-admission/).\n\n**Forget About Dream Schools:** It’s not about finding the school of your dreams; it’s about finding the you of your dreams. When you’re drooling over that perfect school with a perfect campus and perfect classes, you’re not dreaming about any one school. You’re dreaming about who you want to be and where you can become who you want to be. I invite you to think deeply and figure out what it is about that certain school that makes you consider it your dream school — because I guarantee that your dream isn’t out there in the form of a college; it is in YOU.\n\n**Eat Ice Cream:** This is all to say, you’re gonna be ok. Allow yourself to be sad or angry. Sometimes schools make really stupid fucked up decisions, and it’s not a reflection on you, but that doesn’t make it easier to swallow right in the beginning. So be sad or angry. Smash some pillows, angry cry. Go through those feelings, and then go find ice cream -- or chips and queso, you do you. Because every year, after they’ve cried, pounded their pillows, licked their wounds -- and eaten ice cream, seniors come back here on a2c or send me messages and tell me about how even though applying to college was the most stressful experience of their lives, and even though the final outcome wasn’t what they were expecting, they are proud of how much they have grown and learned about themselves. And I have a feeling you’ll be one of those people too.\n\n**You Still Have Options:** I know you might not want to hear this now, but when you’ve gone through some of the pain and come out the other side, it might be helpful to know you still have some great options. You can choose one of the awesome colleges who have shown you love, take a gap year, go to your local community college, or apply to some of the many amazing colleges that are still accepting applications. I will be making a post with the list of NACAC college openings as soon as it's available.\n\n**The Name of a College Does Not Define You:** Now, there’s a lot of people around here in the world of college admissions who don’t agree -- but I am gonna argue this point (maybe that’s because I get old and cranky sometimes, I dunno.) College does not define you. You are the same badass today that you were last week and last fall and when you were five. And you’re gonna find yourself and grow -- no matter where you go to college, so don’t fall into the trap of thinking that the name on a sticker on your laptop or the bumper of your parent’s car defines who you are. It does not. And to parents, where your child goes to college doesn't define you either.\n\nAnd guess what? That doesn’t make the pain any better because you still gotta go through it -- which sucks. But, guess what again? Life sucks sometimes. And sometimes it’s really awesome. Axl Rose says it better, “Life sucks, but in a beautiful kind of way.”\n\n**Financial Aid Frustrations:** Sometimes your application decision might have worked out for you, but the amount of aid you’re receiving makes it an unavailable option. You can – and should – try to appeal your aid before moving on from a college. [Here’s a doc I have with some links and info about financial aid appeals or negotiation.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QF05tCqh9YxvR6Yo0_mpy8OZjWnF_vFBngKSCSobPoo/edit?usp=sharing)**Resources for you to check out if you’re feeling shitty:**\n\n**Feeling the Waitlist Blues, but wanna be a Waitlist Warrior:** Being waitlisted leaves you feeling kind of limbo – like what do I do with this information now? [Here’s my post from yesterday filled with tips and hints and LOCI info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1jlxou8/my_2025_waitlist_faq_and_top_tips_for_writing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nHere are some other resources for you to check out about dealing with this specific kind of admissions dissapointment.\n\n* [My YouTube recorded livestream with u/ScholarGrade about how to handle your decisions](https://youtu.be/zfOJlubzmhs).\n* [Livestream about Gratitude and Handling Shitty Situations with w/McNeilAdmissions, u/Ben-MA, u/ScholarGrade, and my favorite yoga teachers!](https://youtu.be/QYUma8_5V8E)\n* [Message from A2C mods on Ivy Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/tt6gv3/a_message_from_the_mods_on_ivy_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* My Reddit Post about Baby Trees and Lotuses: [You can handle this.

Getting in, or not getting in, to a particular school does not change who you are, the feasibility of your goals, or define you in a substantive way.”\n* [u/PeteyMIT from Mit Blog](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/as-we-approach-decision-day1/) \\-- My fave quote: “all I can remind you is that success is not always a straight line. That your path isn’t something MIT sets you on, it’s something you make yourself.”\n* [Jeff Schiffman, former Director of Admissions at Tulane](https://tuadmissionjeff.blogspot.com/2019/03/its-going-to-be-okay.html) \\-- My fave quote: “What the college admission committee thinks about your application for admission is not what they think about you as a person. It's not a reflection of your character or potential. Admission Offices around the country have internal goals and requirements that they are looking for, and just because you don't meet them, doesn't mean you aren't going to be a great college student somewhere.”\n\nI’m gonna leave you with these wise words from [u/VanderVolted](https://www.reddit.com/u/VanderVolted/), from here on a2c[:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/) “Have you ever played a game where you won every time? It can be fun, but they don’t mean as much. Waitlist/Defers/Rejections suck, they really suck, but they make the good things ( whether they have to do with college acceptances, or even just completely separate things) much better.”\n\n**If you’re feeling so upset that you might do self-harm, Read This:** When you feel like life is beating you down like this, your brain actually makes physical changes and isn’t working properly. You can’t trust it to make wise decisions. It was described to me as if someone was putting heavy weight after weight on your brain - eventually, it’s going to collapse. So give yourself time. Give your brain time to heal. Talk to your parents, get to an ER, reach out to your therapist, or school counselor.\n\n**Resources and Hotlines**\n\n* National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK)\n* Online Chat: [http://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx](https://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx)\n* Crisis Text Line: Text \"START\" to 741-741\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines)\n\nTl;dr: When you don’t get the decision you want, it really hurts. The only way past that pain is to go through it. You have to remember that you are more than your college applications.\n\nXOXOXO AdmissionsMom"

    "body": "Hii!! I figured I might contribute to this thread because I was once on the other end. \n\nI went to a public university for undergrad as a Psychology major. My gpa was generally above a 3.2 (Mostly As and Bs on my transcript, I finished with 1 C in a science GenEd) \n\nI was extremely introverted and barely involved in campus life which I sometimes regret and had 0 internships throughout college. \n\nHowever, I did work as a BHT during my junior year to build my resume and on a last minute whim during the beginning of my senior year, I landed a lab assistant position at my university that I was previously rejected for. I got this position by emailing a bunch of lab coordinators and asking them if they needed any extra help and luckily received 1 reply among the various emails I sent out. My lab coordinator was super nice and ended up signing me up for a research grant, which I was awarded. It wasn’t anything too intricate, I mostly just collected data for a study that the lab was conducting. These two experiences (my time as a BHT and my 2 semesters as a lab assistant) basically checked off what i felt was needed for my resume. \n\nAs for my LORs, I planned ahead of time by emailing some professors way before application season just telling them how much I enjoyed their class and how they’ve positively impacted my college experience. This allowed for some rapport to be built prior to me asking for a LOR, and when the time finally came they were happy to do so. \n\nAs for my personal statement, I just spoke about my own experiences in life that led me to where I am today. I am a BIPOC community member, so it was easy to discuss my own social injustices and those of my friends and family that directly relate to what I wanted to study. Most programs relating to social sciences have a big emphasis on diversity and social justice, so expressing your understanding of that should give extra points. \n\nI applied to 5 programs in total, 2 doctoral (Psy.D) and 3 masters (Clinical Mental Counseling) \nThose were: Towson University, Loyola University of Maryland, George Washington University (Psy.D), The Chicago School of Professional Psychology (Psy.D), and Johns Hopkins University \n\nI interviewed with Loyola, Hopkins and The Chicago school. \n\nI received an instant rejection from George Washington (about a month after I applied) and never heard from Towson university (No disrespect to them but I found that to be very unprofessional. I applied in November and had not heard a single word from them until days leading up to my Graduation, no updates or anything in between then) I took that as a sign because I felt that the severe lack of communication symbolized disorganization within their program. \n\nAll this to say, I was rejected from every school except for Johns Hopkins University; the school I thought I had no chance with although it was my first choice (because how cool would it be to causally say you earned your masters at a school with such prestige??)\n\nI can’t really tell you what I did right or wrong to get accepted by Hopkins and rejected by everyone else. The interview (group interview) seemed very cryptic and I couldn’t tell if I was ever saying the right thing. I can tell you that in each of my responses, I somehow related it back to myself even if the question topic was broad and general. At the time, I deeply regretted it because I was the only one who was responding in that way so I thought it gave a bad impression but I guess not. Going back to my point about social justice, Hopkins holds social justice and diversity as part of their core values, so I believe that my personal anecdotes really stuck out to their admissions team. \n\nAnyways, that’s my story :) Hopefully this helps somebody. I just advise that you fully believe in yourself and your capabilities, and don’t hold yourself back when it comes to applying to schools you feel you might not be good enough for because you just might be exactly what they’re looking for! \n\nCheers and good luck to everyone ❤️"

    "body": "**1.  This essay feels weird to write because it is.**  Like Penn's thank you note, you're writing a letter to someone, but it's actually to an AO.  So you have to do all the mental gymnastics and second guessing as you sort out what to say, not just to a roommate you've never met, but also to the eavesdropping inquisitor who carries your fate in their hands.  Recognize up front that 1) this will feel weird and that's ok, and 2) it might take a lot longer to write and edit than other 250 word essays.  Embrace that and plan on it.\n\n**2.  Less flex, more rizz.**  Remember that [college admission is not an award; it's an invitation to join a community.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/12ngmkh/admission_is_not_an_award_for_being_the_best/)  You are not trying to impress anyone here, and doing so will feel try-hard, sweaty, and off-putting.  You are trying to show a more personal side of who you are, what you love, and what it might look like to be your friend.  As such, anything that could be construed as showy, self-absorbed, or prideful should be left out entirely.  This is NOT your chance to elaborate on your activities/awards - there's already at least three other places in the Stanford application for that.\n\n**3.  Aim for \"just the right level of weird.\"** That means to be yourself, quirks and all, but to also come across as likable, humble, and interesting.  Authenticity is highly valuable in all college applications, and especially in this essay.  Be willing to take a little risk. This is the most important of these tips, and if you hit this one right, the rest often fall into place.\n\n**4.  Try to make it sound, at least a little bit, like something someone might actually write to a roommate rather than an AO.**  Don't try to get cute or meta by mentioning the AO reviewing this or anything else about the admissions process.  Don't imply your cringeworthy desperation by expressing relief over having been admitted to Stanford or having survived the admissions process.  Yes, that would be an awesome accomplishment.  Yes, the admissions cycle feels like a massive crucible judging the value of everything you've ever done and refining it to a single binary outcome.  Yes, it would be both a relief and a joy to get into Stanford.  But this isn't the place for that.  Go talk to your friends or parents, or rant about it on an A2C thread.\n\n**5.  Remember that it's about you.**  As with all components of a college application, the purpose of this essay is for the AOs to understand you better. So show them something about yourself that you haven't already included. The format of this essay allows you to get creative or go way off the beaten path with this.  And that's fine, recommended even.  So be intentional about what you show about yourself.  Consider how you might show ~~the reviewer~~ your \"roommate\" one or more of the following: \n\n- You're someone they would want to meet, spend time with, and maybe even live with\n- You'd be a good fit on campus\n- You have a great personality and interests that transcend college admissions\n- You'll contribute something to the student body - this can span across a multitude of arenas, and almost anything is fair game, including things like how you view welcome as a core value or your passion for Spikeball.\n\n**6.  Show interest in your roommate too.**  Ask some questions. Suggest a couple things you might enjoy exploring together at Stanford.  Invite them to join you in learning/discovering something new, or mention something about them you're looking forward to finding out.  Talk about a shared plan or goal you might pursue together.  And as you do one or more of these, make sure you double check that it sounds like something you actually have interest in or actually want to do.\n\n**7.  Format it like a letter.**  This one is new as of two years ago when Harvard added a roommate supplement.  You should never send Harvard a letter to your roommate or Stanford a list of three things you want your roommate to know about you.  Especially don't send Stanford a bulleted/numbered list.  Don't cross the streams.\n\n**8.  Remember that this is just one small part of your application.**  There are so many other facets and views of you in other components.  So don't try to boil the ocean or tell your whole life story all at once here.  There are other essays to showcase your intellectual vitality, leadership, critical thinking, and other important qualities.  If you try to achieve too much, you'll end up with nothing at all (or worse, a negative portrayal of yourself).\n\n**9.  No, your roommate won't actually be given a copy of this essay.**  Whew.  That's a relief, because that would be pretty cringe.  Note however, that many Stanford students will talk about this essay and swap them around.  Try not to let that cloud your thinking or make this harder than it already is.  But at least you know now.\n\n**10.  Relax, because it's rare for applicants to be admitted on the basis of this one essay.**  Obviously if your letter contains serious red flags, that could materially contribute to your rejection, but otherwise this is just one part of their holistic review.  Having a \"perfect\" essay here won't mean you're in and having an average or even mediocre one won't mean you're out.  So don't spend too many sleepless nights on this because you probably have enough of those anyway.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything you want in the comments below.

    "body": "I’m an incoming freshman, and to save money ($22k/year), my parents are forcing me to commute. My parents tell me that college is a place to study and do not want me to spend much time on social events, and since they both commuted to college in the past, they believe I should be able to as well.\n\nAlthough I can drive, my dad and I share a car for now, and since it’s on the way to his work, he said he can drive me there in the mornings and take me home at night. \n\nWe live about 15 miles away (a trip takes 30 mins during times with less traffic, but up to 1 hr or more during rush hour). He also said he is willing to drive me home really late at night occasionally if needed (even at 12 am).\n\nI’m honestly really nervous because I’m interested in business, which is a field that requires connections. Also, the school I’m going to has a large emphasis on party culture and other social events. I have some savings and can dorm/rent if I really need to, but it’ll take everything I have, and it’s hard for me to imagine that it would be worth it, but the last thing I would want is to end up alone and to try to rent an apartment after everyone has already settled into friend groups after the first two weeks. \n\nSo for me, the pros of commuting are:\n- comfort (I am a bit germo and sheltered, so it’s hard for me to imagine living with strangers)\n- cost (22k/year)\n- maybe better sleep? I heard sleeping in the dorms can be difficult because of the conditions.\n- less distractions\n\nCons:\n- around 1-2 hours each day of my life gone (at least I can maybe work or sleep in the car?)\n- harder to make friends, be involved on campus, may affect my connections in the future\n- have to wake up earlier\n- unable to participate in housing only events\n\nSo I was wondering, given my dad’s flexibility and the fact that I am not the one doing the soul deadening driving, will I still be missing out on a lot of events and experiences if I commute compared to dorming? Will it be significantly harder to make friends, especially as someone who is more introverted? Would it still be possible for me to attend parties (if I really want to) and have the college freshman experience, or do those end too late in the morning? Should I look into getting an apartment despite the cost?\n\nThanks for any help. "

Today, as I'm going through old photos and videos from my freshman year, I am feeling a little nostalgic. I don't know if anyone will read this, but this is my advice to any incoming freshmen.\n\n1) You're so much more awesome than you give yourself credit for.  As someone who has always felt self-conscious and lacked self esteem, there are opportunities I missed to because I felt like \"I wasn't good or cool enough\". I wouldn't go out for certain campus organizations until later because I felt like \"they wouldn't like me\". That's some shit I regret. If you truly want to go achieve or be apart of something, don't let that self-conscious doubt talk you out of it. \n\n2) BE INTERESTED. What does this mean. It means to actually care. When you make friends, remind yourself to be interested in THEM. People want to feel like they are actually being listened to, not just having meaningless conversation to avoid awkwardness. BE INTERESTED. Be interested in your classes. Sometimes classes can get mundane, but I wish I had a better inner voice telling me \"hey, this stuff is cool! How can I use this in my life and how lucky am I to be able to take this \\[insert name\\] course!\". Just care. Find stuff to be interested that is bigger than yourself.\n\n3) Cherish the moments you have with your friends. Friend groups change so much throughout college. The people that you are closest with one year may not be close to you at all the next. It is just how it goes. So enjoy those moments you get because nothing lasts forever. \n\n4) Find what you are passionate about. This is a time in your life to discover what you love. What hobbies or subjects really get you excited? Think long term as well. How can I make this major, hobby, etc into something that can grow down the road, potentially even to make a living off of. \n\n5) Enjoy the ride. The years feel like they only get faster. The speed in which senior year went compared to freshman year is crazy. Be nice to people. BREAK OUT OF YOUR CONFORT ZONE. That is the only way you can be a better you."

My parents are really stressed out and are pressuring me to pick a university. Cost doesn't matter to my family. I applied to most schools with the intention of getting into consulting and possibly pursuing an MBA, but I'm not really sure now(wouldn't mind exploring investment banking or entrepreneurship).\n\nThe reason that I need to decide by tmrw is because 1: my parents want me to decide by the end of this week where to put my deposit. 2: Georgia Tech offered me a spot and said I had to decide by tomorrow...\n\n# UCSD:\n\n**-**  I absolutely loved the UCSD campus. Might be my favorite OAT. \n\n\\- I would be staying in the brand new Marshall dorms. \n\n\\- Rady school of management isn't great, but I think I would enjoy SD. Weather is a pretty big factor to me. \n\n\\- I talked to a guy there and he said he enjoyed it a lot even though its rumored to be \"socially dead.\" Honestly, I really felt like I could fit in here.\n\n# Northeastern London: \n\n**-** Ok... I know a lot of people say bad things about northeastern alt campuses as well as just northeastern itself, but a lot of my family has gone there. \n\n\\- I have family who is faculty there as well as family who attend. I have a lot of friends there, even in London this year, and they said it's the best year that they've ever had. \n\n\\- Apparently not very academically focused for the first year(which ig i wouldn't mind having attended a super competitive high school)\n\n\\-  It is hella expensive, but my parents don't find that to be a problem. \n\n\\- I really love this school, and I could definitely see myself there next year. \n\n# IU Kelley: \n\n**-** Probably the best business school that I got into directly. \n\n\\- I got accepted directly to the business school with a pretty nice scholarship. \n\n\\- The campus is beautiful, but visiting helped me realize that I couldn't be in the middle of nowhere. I would prefer a city. I also didn't like all the Greek life and had a weird encounter with a frat dude. \n\n\\- It felt like a party school, but I knew that I would really benefit from Kelley especially if I wanted to take the consulting path. I have a friend who attends and said he would help me get opportunities and stuff. Just don't know if I can see myself there.\n\n# Washington: \n\n**-** Visited about 2 years ago, and this is definitely up there for most beautiful campus.\n\n\\- don't know if i can handle the rain that much I'm from a very sunny place. \n\n\\- direct admission to the business school, which has a pretty good reputation. \n\n\\- I think I would enjoy it, don't really feel super good or bad about it\n\n# UNC:\n\n\\- just got off the waitlist 2 days ago \n\n\\- Was super hyped until i realized i wasn't a direct admit\n\n\\- Really like the campus(on youtube) and think i could fit in fs, but I hear that it's super difficult to get into the business school after freshman year + most ppl are instate and have their friend groups\n\n\\- will visit the campus later this month\n\n# Georgia Tech:\n\n\\- got into scheller off waitlist but need to do the first year abroad program... which sounds okay, i guess?(i will spend my first semester in France or oxford)\n\n\\- i have to go to school in july💀\n\n\\- don't think i fit into the Georgia Tech vibes\n\n\\- really liked the campus, and I heard good things about the first year abroad program\n\n\\- don't know if i wanna be away first semester u know??\n\n\n\n**Honestly, I have no idea what to pick I'm leaning so many different ways... please lmk any thoughts u have.

    "body": "A student once confessed to me that they didn’t want to go to their first college interview. Despite their parents eagerly hyping them up, they were quite positive they'd have a nervous breakdown in the middle of the interview. It’s easy to be stressed about college interviews, but you’ve made it this far in college admissions, having surmounted obstacles like grades, extracurriculars, writing your essays, and putting together your application. Having a respectful, open, and casual conversation about all of that is much easier than you think.\n\nDon’t believe me? According to Sayaka Smith, a Tufts Undergraduate Admissions Officer, college [interviews](https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/inside-admissions/post/interviewing-part-3-advice-from-the-interviewers) “are meant to be informal conversations, and an alumni interviewer’s job is to get to know you as a 3D human being and tell us a little more about you.” That’s it! You won’t be graded or win points. This isn’t Jeopardy. Your interview isn’t on TV, although you might be on a screen.\n\n**(**[**Click here**](https://www.youtube.com/live/-PEjabSFcwI?si=y5CpvvlrWN-QJUI6) **to follow along in my YouTube Interview workshop!)**\n\nHowever, you do need to prepare for that informal conversation. So, instead of stressing, focus all that nervous energy on what you can do right now:\n\n# Before the Interview\n\n1. **Research the School’s Interview Process:** Lots of schools have different methods for the way they conduct interviews -- and some even have different interview deadlines, so you need to read their websites carefully. Put all of that information into a new “Interview” Column in your College Application Organization Spreadsheet.\n\n1. **Stay Connected:** You don’t want to miss any electronic communications from the college. You especially don’t want to miss news about college interviews. Start regularly checking your inbox, as well as your spam, social, promotional, and junk folders, for communications. Clear out your voicemail — or set one up and make sure your message is appropriate. Check your portal in case they leave info there.\n2. **Do the Interview!** There’s data out there showing a striking difference in acceptance rates for those who interview and those who don’t (if the opportunity is available to them). So, if the school offers you an interview, do it! Even if they say that the interview is technically “optional” (you do know that there is mostly no such thing as \"optional\" in college admissions language, right?).\n\n***Interview Prep***\n\n1. **Light Interview Prep:** You have to be careful during this part. The temptation to memorize monologues about yourself is real, I know, but don’t do it. DO NOT MEMORIZE. DO NOT REHEARSE. Why not rehearse?You’ll sound stiff, false, like a robot. Have you ever tried to have a conversation with someone who had a list of points they were trying to blow through no matter what you wanted to talk about? It’s not a conversation any longer. It becomes an awkward trap where one party is just talking at the other and everyone just wants it to be over. What you need to do is come prepared to talk about yourself. In the days leading up to your interview, think about why you love the school so much, how your academic experience, extracurriculars, interests, and ambitions demonstrate who you are. All of that will be much more interesting to the interviewer\n\n1. **Create your Magical, Story-Collecting Invisible Backpack:** Prepare ahead of time with your invisible backpack full of stories about you. The best way to answer a question is with a story about yourself. Think of lots of little stories about you that represent who you are and what's important to you. That way, you can pull them out as they fit the questions. DO NOT memorize them. Instead of thinking of specific answers to specific questions, try thinking of themes or collecting stories about yourself that you can share. Think of it as your magical story-collecting backpack that you wear to the interview. There's nothing memorized -- just stories that explore who you are and are brought to the forefront of your mind for easy recall.\n\n1. If you need some help to get those thoughts flowing, check out my lists of college interview questions I collect every year:\n   1. [Favorite Questions from College Interviewers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HqQXy_Sl6tNF-KGdwuJC6BJv4PYs9cGb/view?usp=sharing)\n   2. [Even More Interview Questions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SAVLPpfpm2Knz4i4DLZfSJLQ_k6_HmD3/view?usp=sharing)\n\n1. **Prepare a One-Page Highlights Resume:** If the college or the interviewer doesn’t explicitly tell you not to, I recommend having a “One-Page Just-the-Highlights” Resume ready to hand to the interviewer. This gives the interviewer something to refer to during the interview and later when they write their notes. Of course, some schools specifically say not to bring a resume, so be sure you read all the directions they send you. For in-person interviews, hand it to them when you first sit down. If they use it, great. If they put it aside and never look at it again, no biggie. For virtual interviews, you can make it ready to link in the chat (or you could send it to them ahead of time linked in an email). Save it as a PDF in a Google Drive, so you can link it in the chat or easily screen share. Make sure you share permissions for them to open it. I suggest letting anyone open it so you don't have to worry about whether they have the right email or not while chatting with you. If they don’t use it, it’s no biggy.\n\n1. **Get in the Zone:** The night before the interview, do the basic but essential preparation stuff — make sure your clothes are prepared. Go over the next day’s schedule and ensure you’ve given yourself enough time to get to the interview location and get into the right frame of mind. For virtual interviews, click on the Zoom link to make sure you know where it is! For in-person, plan out your route to get there and plan to arrive at least 15 minutes early. Get a good night’s sleep.\n\n1. **Do a Virtual Tour or Info Session before!** Go on the college's website and watch some virtual tours or sign up for an Info Session.\n\n1. **For Virtual Sessions, Practice with your Computer:** Make sure your camera works. Lift your computer enough so that you are looking into the camera at eye level. Practice with your mom or a friend. Make sure you have lighting in front and behind you -- especially in front of you. Put a lamp just behind your computer so that your beautiful smile is sure to show!\n\n1. **For Virtual Sessions, Arrange the Time and Space with your Family.** Let them know ahead of time that you'll be interviewing, so you'll need some quiet space for half an hour or an hour or so. Sit in a location where if your family has to walk around you, they'll be going in front of your computer, not behind you. Your interviewer definitely doesn't want to see your dad walking around in his underwear! If you are in your room, then make your bed and tidy the space.\n\n# The Day Of\n\n1. **What to Wear:** Wear something you are comfortable in and that makes you feel confident. You don’t need to wear a suit, but you must look tidy. Wear a clean shirt with a collar, tucked in, and if you’re in person -- a clean pair of pants or jeans with a belt (if you have pants other than jeans, wear them). You can wear a nice but not-too fancy dress, a clean skirt, or pants with a blouse or shirt, tucked in. NO inappropriate T-shirts or dirty, stained, or torn clothes. Clean up your tennis shoes. Consider removing piercings beyond ear piercings. Wash and comb your hair. Get a haircut if you need it. Shave or trim your beard if you have one. No need for anything too elaborate, but you must look clean and neat and not like you just rolled out of bed.\n\n1. **Bring your Questions:** As Finding\\_Snoo says in their [great post here on ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i77vhq/what_i_wished_i_knew_before_i_did_virtual/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), make sure to bring your list of uneasily googleable questions. If the information can be found on the website, don't ask. But it is okay to ask them to explain something or elaborate about something on the website. Personal questions that connect to the interviewer can be useful: ask about their favorites on campus and their experiences.\n\n1. **Get There Early:** For virtual, plan to log on 10 or 15 minutes early so you have time to deal with tech problems, make last-minute adjustments with lighting and camera angles, run to the bathroom one last time, etc. For in-person, early so you don’t stress out. Double-check your planned route. Plan ahead how early you need to leave to arrive 15 minutes early, and then leave 15 minutes before that time.\n\n1. **Superman It**: When you get there or when you’re all set up and ready to go on your computer, go take one last trip to the bathroom. After you take care of business, go look at yourself in the mirror, put your hands on your hips, and stand up nice and tall. [Do the Superman Pose](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superheroes/201107/why-you-may-want-stand-superhero) and take some deep breaths.\n\n# During the Interview\n\n***Make your Introductions***\n\n* Smile: Don’t force it, but try to relax and enjoy yourself a little. Again, this is just a little chat between you and the interviewer.\n\n* Make Eye Contact: This is important and can be tricky on a virtual chat. Resist the urge to watch yourself in the video and keep your focus on your interviewer. Make sure you look the interviewer in the eye so they know you’re engaged and paying attention. Not too much. It’s not a staring contest. Be confident but natural.\n\n* Introduce yourself. The easiest and most confident way to do this is to state your name during the handshake if you’re in-person, and for virtual, just wave, smile, and say something like Hi, I’m Carolyn. Nice to meet you! (but don’t use Carolyn, that would be ridiculous unless your name is Carolyn.)\n\n* Shake hands. If you’re in-person and you feel comfortable with a handshake, you can stick your hand out, but remember not everyone is comfortable with this level of touch, so be respectful.  Think of a good handshake as about the degree of firmness you would need to hold onto a doorknob to open a door. A little bow is fine, too.\n* Be Engaged\n\n* Silence and put away your phone: (The only exceptions would be something like they ask to see a picture of an art project you did and you happen to have one on your phone. Make sure there’s nothing potentially embarrassing to scroll past!)\n\n* Remember to breathe.\n\n* Keep Smiling and Making Eye Contact: Consider your non-verbal communication. Nod, lean in to listen, and use your hands to speak. If you’re interested in learning a little more about nonverbal communication, [here are my short notes from a recent webinar I went to about nonverbal communication and body language.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qp-0Nx2fsI1mk9WUn-7OCfxs0qsWnFhG/view?usp=sharing)\n* Listen to your Interviewer: Respond to the questions. The numero uno thing colleges tell us to share with you is to LISTEN to the interviewer! Don’t come with an agenda of what you want to say or come off as overly-practiced or memorized. They could end up noting that in their write-up.\n\n* Lean into your nerves: Own it. Being nervous is okay. You can tell the interviewer if you're feeling a little nervous. This will help them know to help you along. They don’t want you to fail. More than likely, they've been nervous about something really important to them a time or two, too.\n\n* Take Notes: It's okay to take occasional notes as you're talking in case there's something you want to come back to, but be sure you aren't staring down the whole time.\n\n* Remember to Breathe. Make sure you're continuing to breathe. There's no rush.\n\n* As it ends, thank them and make sure you have their contact info.\n\n# After the Interview\n\nWrite a Thank You Note After The Interview. If you meet in person, ask for a business card so you can jot down a quick thank you note and send it when you get home. Try to send an email that evening or afternoon or the next morning. Be gracious, be grateful for their time, and be specific about something they said that made you think about or particularly excited about the school. Thank them for taking the time to talk to you. Be friendly and warm. Use good grammar. Don’t worry if you don’t hear back from them. It doesn’t mean anything at all.\n\nAnd That’s It! See how direct and simple this is once you divvy up what you have to do? After you’ve handled that huge college application checklist, this interview process will be a piece of cake. If nothing else, you’ll feel more confident, which will make you a more engaging and exciting interviewee.\n\n**Oh! One More Thing!**\n\nI get asked all the time about how important interviews are. And, of course, the answer to that question, just like in pretty much all things college admissions, is it depends. Interviews with admissions counselors from colleges are indeed important and they will be accounted for in your evaluation -- as far as how much? Who knows -- back to “it depends on the college.” In my experience, alum interviews are a great time to get to know more about the colleges and share a little about yourself, but not a whole lot more. I think a horrible interview could tank you, but beyond that, not too much. Many kids I know have had alum interviews that positively rocked, and they still weren’t admitted and other kids have had alum interviews that they felt were very ho-hum or even worse, and they were admitted. So my point is, don’t overthink it. Think about these interviews as life practice. Not as making or breaking your college apps.\n\n  \nI'd love to hear you interview worries, stories, favorite questions, mishaps, and things that went well!\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nBe early. Smile. Breathe. Bring a magical backpack filled with your stories. Listen. Breathe. Write a thank-you note.\n\n"

We’re less than a week away from National Decision Day, and I know a lot of people are still feeling torn or anxious about where to go.\n\nI just want to remind everyone that no matter where you end up choosing, at the end of the day, four years of undergrad is really what you make of it. Once you’re actually on campus, it’s more about how you adjust and adapt to college life, how you build your routine, how you approach your classes, how you carve out a space for yourself. You want to be thinking about things like:\n\n* How well you can adapt to college life\n* The effort you put into your classes\n* Building that strong GPA\n* Getting involved with clubs, team, orgs, or research\n* Taking advantage of what resources the campus has to offer\n* Connecting with professors and classmates\n* Networking with alumni\n* Building a support system and community around you\n\nNo matter where you go, you’re entering a much bigger network. And that’s something you can build on. I think it’s easy to get caught up in prestige or rankings or whether you made the “right” choice—but honestly, once you land somewhere and really plug into that place, every choice becomes the right choice.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who went through college and looks back now and realizes: being on a campus, surrounded by so many other young people, all learning, all figuring things out, being intellectually curious—it’s such a rare space to be in. You’ll never really have that exact type of environment again. So wherever you decide to go, just start thinking forward. Think about how you want to show up and what you want to get out of it. Again, especially when you're a few years down the line and look back to reflect: at that point, every choice you made was the right choice as part of a greater path.\n\nAnd if things *really* don’t work out—if the fit isn’t right after your first year, or even into sophomore year—there’s always the option to transfer. Paying a deposit doesn’t mean you’re locked in forever.\n\nSo yeah, I just wanted to remind folks that wherever you land, it’s not really all about the name—it’s about what you do with your time there. Good luck to everyone finalizing their decisions this coming week!"

    "body": "Tl;dr – Occidental College is the only small liberal arts college in a major city: Los Angeles. We have caring, supportive faculty and an engaging, social justice-oriented student body. If you’re the type of student to take advantage of this experience, Oxy is for you. \n\nAround this time a bit ago, I had the choice between Occidental, Pitzer, Wesleyan, Bates, and Vassar. After deep reflection and pondering, I decided to choose my gut feeling:  Oxy.\n\nIt was the correct decision. \n\nOccidental College gets a bad rap on this subreddit. The top result is a post by a former student deriding the school, discouraging people from applying entirely. While some criticisms may ring true in that post, as it  provides a snapshot of the dysfunction brought about by Covid, I hope to provide my incredibly positive perspective to this sub, highlighting why it's one of the most unique and exciting college experiences. \n\nTo start, a realization. During orientation, I sat in the back of Thorne Hall, and scanned the back of heads. Around 500 heads were there, the students I’d live with for the next four years. \n\nAlthough it seems so obvious, I realized that everyone chose Oxy for similar reasons as I did.\n\nEveryone knew what type of school Occidental College was when they applied. The admissions department communicated a certain experience to the prospective applicants, then proceeded to accept certain students to curate a vibe and personality to match that experience. By choosing to enroll here, you decide to join a cohort who wants an interdisciplinary liberal arts experience, wants to emphasize social justice and critical engagement, and wants to be in LA.\n\nIn addition, Oxy is in a position where applicants aren’t applying simply for name recognition or ranking. As this sub has discussed, many schools have lost their ‘personalities’, as some applicants seemingly apply only to top schools and choose to attend the highest ranked one, disregarding factors of experience and vibe. In turn, many schools have lost their personality, like UChicago and NYU. The canon of ‘elite’ LACs are often included on these applicants lists, which dilutes what makes them unique. \n\nOxy is not in the canon of ‘elite’ small liberal arts colleges, but it still absolutely provides a rigorous education and fulfilling experience. Most importantly, it has maintained and strengthened its personality. \n\nThe personality: We are deeply passionate about our interests, and we care for our peers and the world. I’ve met incredible minds who are eager to get out to create and engage, whether they be filmmakers, writers, culture enthusiasts, or just people who want to make deep personal connections. We’re especially deeply committed to social justice issues, and genuinely want to make the world a more just and equitable place. Conversations on the quad take existential turns, as we dig deeper to pursue truth, or perhaps deconstruct the notion of “truth” entirely. We don’t take things for how they are–– we seek perspectives and identify connections  and contradictions. What unconscious biases are at play? How did this movie subvert narratives and tropes? How can I bring up Foucault? While this may be the personality at other colleges too, we happen to have the backdrop of cosmopolitan Northeast Los Angeles. \n\nOxy has a beautiful campus across the gorgeous neighborhoods of Eagle Rock and Highland Park. It’s a surreal feeling to be in such a… main character city. I’ve heard Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus walk their dogs on campus in early mornings, and I’ve run into Mahershala Ali, Finneas, and countless niche microcelebrities on adjacent York Blvd (like Dan Hentschel!). I’ve been able to go to events like the Dodgers Parade, Frieze LA 2025, and also participate in major protests across the city. I’m constantly reminded of our incredible location by the panoramic views of the city from upper campus. Downtown is a 15 minute drive and the beach is a 45 minute drive (all depending on traffic…). If not for our incredible dining options on campus, I’d probably eat at local spots and food trucks more often. Of course, LA is not the most walkable city, but the majority of students have cars on campus and parking is entirely free. \n\nWe’re not in an academic ivory tower in rural Maine–– we’re in the second largest city in the country. It means our activists organize and put theory into practice where it's needed, our social science students gather and apply meaningful data, and our artists / musicians / filmmakers engage and create within their respective preeminent scenes. Courses tend to incorporate community engagement and ample field trips into their curriculums. I’ve been able to form so many connections on these excursions with the local community, and I’m eager to continue these relationships into professional settings. According to career advisors and professors, graduate schools are allured by Occidental and other southern California liberal arts colleges. We supposedly provide a unique, critical, and interdisciplinary education that places our alumni in elite grad programs.\n\nOxy attracts a certain type of student AND a certain type of professor. Our professors also want to be in LA, and they want to critically engage with us. It’s no surprise that there are plenty of professors here who are alumni. They are often practitioners themselves, often as young, eager adjunct professors. I love to pull up to office hours just to have conversations about life, culture, and affairs. Student research opportunities across all disciplines are plenty. The faculty are all incredibly passionate about their students, pedagogy, and subject matter.\n\nFor the most part, we’re a “going out” school on the weekends. Night plans could be going out to spots in Silverlake or WeHo, to small local concerts and events, or to USC / UCLA for their frats. There isn’t a centralized campus party scene on campus, which I don’t mind. For the most part, our Greek Life is dying, which I actively pray for the downfall of. There are only two sororities and one fraternity left, which struggle to attract and attain membership each year. The few parties that are thrown on / nearby campus are often hosted by Cross Country or Basketball in their off-campus team houses. These are by no means ragers, and there’s an expectation of good behavior and accountability. Nobody tends to behave too wildly or inappropriately, as we’re such a small student body that will take matters of accountability into our own hands if the administration doesn’t. \n\nPlenty of people transfer after their first year for various reasons. Some seek schools with academic departments that more closely match their area of interest, others are turned off by the lack of greek life or campus parties, and some just don’t align with the critical and social justice-oriented education and student body. People transfer to schools like Tulane, Syracuse, and UMich–– which should illustrate our contrasting schools. I totally support them–– don’t try to thug out a college experience you don’t align with. It is one of the most fulfilling experiences in my life to attend a college that truly is a perfect fit, and everyone should seek that out. \n\nOf course, there are issues. Air conditioning is not one of them anymore–– all remaining dorms are adding AC this summer. Regardless, the school administration isn’t necessarily the most capable or efficient one. It does sometimes feel like they move at a slug’s pace to respond to student requests and accommodations. The course catalog for the upcoming fall semester has yet to be released. Perhaps they have also made some investment choices that go against the institution’s mission statement and core values, repeating an unfortunate mistake that history won’t look kindly on. It doesn't help them that their student body is constantly calling them out and won’t put up with it. \n\nAs we have all experienced, the world can change very quickly. In the fall, I had hopes of entering academia or higher education work upon graduation. Many of my peers had their dream careers in public health, at the EPA, and even USAID. Higher education and social justice in general is under siege right now, and may look very different in a few years. Perhaps a liberal arts education has taken on a new meaning in our generation. Whatever the world may look like as time marches on through graduation, my classmates and I will have a critical toolset to engage with the world, and we will have an understanding that there is no higher purpose in life than committing oneself to helping others.\n\nThat being said, there is no place I’d rather be than amongst my peers in this location for my formative college years. I am surrounded by a group of people who I can’t wait to spend the foreseeable future with, and then continue to stay connected with later in life. I frequently have conversations with friends about how much we’ve learned both in and outside of the classroom. I love all of my peers and professors, and I can’t help but be overwhelmed by the beauty of this great metropolis and the interhuman connection on campus. \n\nGood luck with RD results tonight, 2029! Feel free to message me if you have questions. "

    "body": "Just a couple of months ago, I was so happy and proud of myself. I had received three offers from excellent programs for a PhD in Chemistry. I did my visitation weekends, everything looked promising, and I had made my decision to attend Columbia University, not just because it’s a great program, but because one of the faculty there was just as excited about me as I was about them. Additionally, I would be moving closer to my family, and we were all excited about everything being perfect. Cut to today, and nearly everything has blown up in my face. Thanks to the funding cuts and the deliberate targeting of Columbia by the Trump administration, the professor I was supposed to join just let me know last week she may be losing several major grants and can’t say for certain that she’ll be able to fund me past my first year of PhD. I reached out to faculty at the other institutions I received offers from, and it’s the same story across the board. My offers stand, I’m welcome to come, but securing a lab position is going to be hard because professors are struggling to support the students they already have. I can defer for a year at two out of three of the universities, but there’s no guarantee it’ll get better in a year. It may get worse. I’ve been told by some faculty that I should consider taking a few years off and working in industry in the meantime, as if there isn’t also a severe shortage of jobs which is about to get worse considering the number of folks in academia losing their positions.\n\nI know I’m not alone in this, people everywhere are feeling this pressure, but I’m so tired of grieving for science. I’m actually getting quite pissed off. To the point that it’s on sight the second I hear anyone in my life say anything remotely political regarding science, medicine, or education. I’m defensive all the time and it’s exhausting, but this political climate is literally ruining my life and I don’t feel like being kind or patient with people anymore. I don’t want to live my life this way, but I’m so over having to take two steps forward and one step back every time I make progress in my life. I’m not giving up, I’m already in my mid-30s and I have put way too much into this career, but just once - JUST ONCE - I need it to not be an uphill battle to do the right thing.\n\nOn the bright side, between surviving undergrad during a pandemic and getting a PhD in this dystopian nightmare, I can safely say that this generation of academics is going to be tough as nails. Not that we need anymore character building arcs.\n\n\n*************************************************\nETA some updates and clarifications for people who are confused by this situation: \n\n1) Yes, Columbia has a massive multibillion dollar endowment. However, it largely can’t be touched because endowments are usually tied up in resources like real estate and land, and even if it was liquidated is only allowed to be used in specific ways. It’s not like dipping into a savings account like a rainy day. I don’t know the finer points of university financials myself, but from everything I’ve read, you can’t expect it to be able to quickly cash in on that endowment because of various legal constraints. \n\n2) A scientific PhD is a 5 year commitment to completing continuous research with funding. This funding does not come from me. There is nothing I can do personally to raise money. This isn’t the same as an undergraduate degree where you just pay your tuition and you get to stay. Scientific research comes from grant funding. Running a lab costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions. I can’t just get a scholarship and be fine. It’s my research, not just me, that must be funded. If my lab does not have funding to support my project, it’s over. I get sent home and have to reapply for other programs somewhere else. There is no such thing as going for a year, then coming back a few years later when this blows over. I will have to start over from the beginning, and I don’t know if you know this, but graduate level work is HARD. It’s not something you want to keep doing over and over indefinitely. There may be options for transferring to a different lab, but that also comes with serious ramifications, such as having to start a multi year project over. \n\n3) Yes, Columbia is a hot bed for political troubles. Despite everything, I believe that Columbia is the best place for me because it has the project and faculty that I specifically want to work with. It is something I have had to consider, as well as all the challenges of living in NYC, but in the end, there is no escaping political unrest at this time. The current administration has made all of science and academia political. There isn’t a single institution that I have applied to or received an offer from that isn’t feeling extreme political and financial pressure at this point in time. I believe that these institutions and faculty are doing their best to protect their students and the future of research from a corrupt and reactionary political regime. They were served federal warrants and are being given ultimatums in order to restore critical funding. It’s not as easy as “they should stand up to the orange man!” They still have to comply with federal laws. You should be mad at government enacting these injustices, not the institutions being attacked. You might disagree. We’ll have to agree to disagree. I have too much on my plate to worry about your opinions on the matter. \n\n4) After talking to several people close to me and a few of my mentors, I believe I will still choose to go to Columbia regardless of the uncertainty. I don’t know if I’ll ever get an opportunity like this again in my life, and I think one year guaranteed funding there, learning and researching alongside some of the best scientists in my chosen field, is still better than deferring for a year and trying to find work in an oversaturated job market. I don’t know if I could forgive myself for giving up now when I’m so close to my dream. And who knows? It might work itself out in the meantime. \n\n5) I am still mad. Not at any faculty or institution for their honesty or doing what they have to do to survive in this climate, but at the political situation itself, the demonization of science and education, and the injustice of this administration trying to bully us into submission by attacking and targeting students and research. This will continue to be a hot button issue with me until it stops. The damage being done this year will ripple through upcoming years, and the fact that these deleterious policies are being applauded by goons who have no understanding of what they are cheering on will always play out in mind as I pursue my career in academia. I wonder if I’ll ever not be mad. "

    "body": "TL;DR: What the title says :/\n\nBasically, when I was in 7th grade and didn't know anything about what I wanted to do, my parents hired a professional college admissions consultant for an exorbitant amount of money. I'm lucky that they chose an ethical one. She never wrote a single word for me, only helped me brainstorm and edit with the helpful perspective of a college admissions counselor. She helped me decide what field I wanted to go into and helped me plan my classes, SAT testing, college application strategy, extracurriculars, etc.\n\nI worked really hard to follow her help and make my parents' money worthwhile, but in the end was only admitted to a handful of large public schools that I expected. I was rejected by nearly all the Ivies, MIT and Stanford, UCLA and Berkeley, Duke, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, and a few \"public Ivies\". I'm really proud of everything I've done and worked for, but my parents were disappointed to say the least.\n\nI've already decided to attend one of the T40 public schools I got into (nondisclosure) and am pretty confident in my choice. The school has a great (not an Ivy but still wonderful) program for my major and I'll have a few friends I know there, so I'm really looking forward to it. The only thing I'm still a little sad about is the fact that I really wanted to go to a mid-size to smaller private school, just for that student-professor connection. So I think I'll still try to transfer to a smaller school, but I won't be angry if I (most likely) won't be able to.\n\nMy parents keep lamenting that I didn't take advantage of my college counselor enough and feel they deserve their money back. The admissions counseling website claims that 90% of their students get into one of their top 3 choices. My parents bemoan the fact that I am the 10%. They are encouraging me to \"work hard so you can transfer out\", as if my choice in college is some jail for stupid, insignificant people. I tried to explain to them that of course I will put my best effort in, but transfer rates are impossibly low and they shouldn't expect much. My parents continued to insist that \"just because the rates are low doesn't mean its impossible for YOU\". I want to work hard in college because I enjoy working hard, not because I want to go \"somewhere better\". \n\nI truly don't know how to feel. In the beginning I felt like an imposter in the field my counselor had \"chosen\" for me, but as I've done extracurriculars in the field I have really begun to love it and am hoping to do grad school/a PhD in it. I am happy with my school choice even though it isn't some top 10 elite Ivy, and excited for my freshman year like any other senior.\n\nAnd yet, I can't help but feel guilty over \"wasting\" my parents' money. We're well off, but $25,000 is no joke. They had already secured jobs and toured houses in the New England area, because they were so confident I would get in to one of the East Coast schools (my college is on the West Coast). They email my counselor on the regular discussing transfer attempts and what went wrong in my applications.\n\nMany Asian parents place an implicit expectation on their kids to get into a top tier school, but paying for a college counselor makes the expectation very explicit. It doesn't help that I'm the oldest sibling, and my parents have been letting me know that my younger siblings look up to me for years. I also feel guilty because my younger siblings had a truly unwavering faith in me.\n\nEvery time I try to bring up how excited I am for freshman year, or make plans to visit them, they always turn the conversation back to how I need to transfer out, how it's such a shame. What am I supposed to say?\n\nSorry this is long lol I've been agonizing"

    "score": 1459,
    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1gw0by5/some_perspectives_from_the_other_side/",
    "body": "I am a professor on the admissions committee at a medium sized T20 engineering department in the US and wanted to share some honest perspectives from the other side, as we often aren't allowed to explicitly answer certain types of applicant questions. For example, many applicants want to know our acceptance rate which are not supposed to share. My program accepts roughly 35-40 students out of 600+ applications, and our yield tends to be somewhere between 50-60% of those admits join the program.\n\n**Our process:** the admissions committee reviews applicants and ranks them on a score from 1 to 3, where 1 is excellent, 2 is good, and 3 is unsuitable. Most applicants are fairly realistic about their chances of getting in, I would estimate roughly 10% get rank 1, 85% rank 2, and only 5% of odd cases are ranked 3. After that, the scores and application materials are shared with the rest of the department. We are a direct-match program (i.e., students get accepted directly to individual lab groups, rather than as a cohort), so individual PIs then get to decide who they will interview. The admissions committee will make notes of which professors should look closely at which applicants. Not every professor will have funding for new PhD students every year, so many applications (even excellent ones) are never strongly considered. Rank 2 applicants are sometimes accepted if the research fit with the professor is very good.\n\nYou may have heard this before, but there is **no such thing as a safety school** for graduate applications. We routinely reject rank 1 applicants simply because there isn't a professor in their field of interest who has an open position that year. So having the best profile does not mean you will get accepted, you also need to get lucky that the right position in the right group is funded for you that year. For smaller, less research active schools, this means that there are often fewer positions available, so some of those programs may actually be harder to get into compared to larger and higher ranked programs like MIT, Michigan, and Georgia Tech which need to hire large numbers of students to support their massive research programs.\n\n**GPA matters.** While research proficiency is most important for a PhD, a poor undergraduate GPA doesn't bode well for your chances of successfully completing the pre-requisite coursework in a graduate program. These classes are hard, and if you are spending all of your time studying just to do okay, you won't have time to start research and your chances of passing the qualifying exam will be lower. Many professors consider \\~3.7 or above to be acceptable, but top applicants usually have 3.8 or above. I don't say this to discourage you if your GPA is lower, but I also don't want to sugar coat what type of profile tends to be accepted.\n\nA question I see all of the time is: **does research experience offset a mediocre GPA?** The diplomatic answer you'll get from most admissions staff is that applications are reviewed holistically and there is no minimum GPA. But the honest answer is: probably not. Several applicants will have both research experience and an excellent GPA, and in many cases the \"superstar\" rank 1 candidates will have a higher GPA **in addition** to more research experience than a rank 2 applicant with a decent GPA and some research experience.  Out of the 100s of applications I have read, I can only think of one case where a candidate had a 3.2 GPA but such excellent research experience and letters of recommendation that the application was still strongly considered.\n\nAnother common misconception is the importance of publishing as an undergraduate or masters student. Having a publication can certainly boost your application, but it is far from a prerequisite. We routinely accept students who have no publications. Doing science takes time, and doing good science is usually especially slow. In fact, having your name on subpar publications might actually work against you. I was recently contacted by an international masters student who has more publications than me, because their father is a professor who has been adding their name to all of his (not very good) publications for the last 6 years. I am fairly confident that this super-obvious \"gaming\" of the academic system will result in this student getting rejected from all top programs. Then they will go to grad cafe or reddit and complain about how impossible it is to get accepted into graduate school if they got rejected despite having X number of papers. So don't get discouraged if you haven't published when you read those types of posts!\n\nAnother common question seems to be whether international students are at a disadvantage. The sad answer is yes. This is for a few reasons: (1) there are many funding mechanisms only open to US students (the big one being NSF GRFP, but there are several others), making it easier for professors without enough funding to accept them, (2) we know exactly what a 3.9/4.0 from the University of Delaware means, it might be harder to evaluate a 9.0/10 from IISc, (3) we are more likely to have a connection to, or know of, the professors at American universities writing letters for those students. The deck is especially stacked against Iranian applicants. Although there are many wonderful junior scientists in Iran we would love to bring over, the reality of visa delays/rejections and extra scrutiny means many programs/professors can't or won't gamble on making offers to those students. If you are international, don't give up hope though! There aren't enough excellent American students to fill all the US programs, so most top schools still end up with a majority of international students. You just might need to apply more broadly than an American student would.\n\nMake sure to get your applications in on time, including letters of recommendation and IETLS/TOEFL scores. While exceptions might be made for superstar candidates, last year we weren't even forwarded the applications that weren't completed at the deadline. I had a few students reach out to me to ask if I'd seen their application, and I hadn't because their IETLS scores were delayed and the admissions staff had only sent us complete applications.\n\nMy final thought is to make sure your personal statement reads well, especially the first few paragraphs. This is the first part of the application we look at and we generally make a judgement fairly early in reading. I try to do the courtesy of reading each statement in its entirety because I feel that we owe that to applicants who put so much time into applying, but the reality is that many professors will skim the statements and make a snap judgement since we are analyzing so many.  If you aren't a strong writer, **use AI** to help! AI writing tools can help level the playing field for non-native English speakers. **However, do not** copy and paste directly from chatgpt. It is incredibly obvious when someone has done so. Make sure the statement still has your distinct voice and thoughts and does not include generic wording that doesn't tell us anything about you. Sentences such as \"I love XX field because I have always liked math and physics\" are true of every engineering applicant. I want to know more about you as a person, and every word you choose to include in this statement should help make your case. I realize that this is easy advice to give, and not easy advice to incorporate, but do your best to think about what makes you unique and interesting. Also, don't be afraid to brag a about your accomplishments. If you have published, won awards, conducted outreach, etc., include that in your statement. Give us context for awards we may not have heard of (selected out of XX applicants), include metrics of impact (my outreach project was shared with XX number of low income students). Give us context to your research experiences (how long were you with a group, did you work alone or under a postdoc/phd student, what tools did you use, what were your main contributions to any resulting publications, etc.). And of course, have someone proofread. Sentences that make sense to you might sound like gibberish to someone else, which is why we often cannot effectively evaluate our own writing.\n\nI hope this helps, best of luck with your applications everyone!\n\n  \n**Edit:** I am going to stop replying and close reddit on my computer soon, as I need to do some real work, but wanted to share a few final thoughts based on responses.\n\nA number of comments are asking for \"chance me\" based on their profile, which is really difficult to do. If you take away anything from this post, it should be that graduate admissions can be very subjective and even random, especially when decisions are left to each individual professor. You can absolutely be accepted to a top program with a 3.2, and you can also be rejected with a 4.0. The last thing I want to do is discourage anyone from pursuing their dream program, but I also want to be honest about what types of candidates are typically accepted to top programs. For example, my last few years of admits:\n\n* 3.5 UG, 3.9 M.S. International, 2 research experiences, 1 publication, 1 presentation, leadership experience, letter of recommendation from a professor I know and trust. SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific research field and as well as the application I care about\n* 3.85 UG, 3.95 MS. International, 2 research experiences, 2 presentations and 1 in-progress publications (but not published), leadership and volunteer experience. Referred by trusted colleague, excellent research fit.  \n* 16.5/20 UG, 3.7 MS. International, 3 research experiences, 2 publications, significant outreach experience, amazing letters of recommendation from unknown professors. SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific research and application I care about\n* 3.98 UG GPA. American, URM, 2 research experiences, no publications, significant outreach experience. Letter from a trusted colleague.  SOP indicated very strong interest in my specific field and and application\n* 3.8 UG GPA, dual major. American, URM, 2 research experiences, presentation but no publications, excellent leadership experience, referred by a trusted colleague. SOP a bit vague but good enough alignment with my research \n* 3.9 UG GPA, american. Top UG program. Awards, 1 research experience, one publication, 2 presentations, volunteer, leadership, outreach experience, excellent letters from unknown professors. SOP reflected good alignment with my research, but not with my application.  \n\nYou might notice a common theme is that referrals/letters from other professors I know personally hold a lot of weight. I have used the phrase \"take a gamble\" a lot in my comments, because that is what we are doing when we accept students. In between tuition, stipend, fringe, overhead, and research/travel costs, it costs over $100,000/year to train a PhD student at my institution. This is money we professors need to painstakingly fundraise. Because PhD positions are some weird combination of a job and a training program, making a bad hire can have an enormous impact on our research programs. It's not like a normal job where I can just fire someone if they aren't working out 2 months in. The last thing any professor wants to do is spend 200-300k training someone who ultimately isn't productive and burns out early because they actually don't care about the research area. This is why programs are so weird about \"**why us?**\" We want you to convince us that you will be happy and successful in this program and aren't going to drop out.  You might be the strongest applicant in the pile in terms of raw metrics, but if we don't see the clear alignment of interests you may not be accepted. \n\nPersonally, I am also very interested in personality match. I don't want to spend 5 years butting heads with someone because we have different priorities and working styles, and I especially don't want someone who will make the rest of my group miserable by being a pain to work with. This is why I put a lot of weight into personal recommendations from people I know. By the time I am interviewing candidates, it's really more of a \"vibe check\" than trying to assess competency. All professors are different though, some will really grill candidates for technical competency, which I personally find unproductive. \n\nFinally, if your profile is not as strong as the ones I have mentioned, please **do not despair** or give up hope on doing a PhD. I am describing the admissions process at a very competitive top program located in a highly desirable city. There are many R1s with high research activities and plenty of funding that don't make it onto top 20 lists. For example, state schools in \"rural\" states have access to a separate pot of NSF funding that coastal states do not have. The university of texas system has their own sizeable endowment. There are many excellent, T100 programs physically adjacent to top schools that are sometimes overlooked by applicants (i.e., NJIT near Princeton). Top schools located in less desirable locations will also be less selective. Because of the political climate there, colleagues from red / southern states have been complaining recently about not getting enough female and out-of-state applicants in their pools. Canadian programs have a very different funding mechanism than the US which results in more equitable distribution of funding across their various schools. Finally, try to find out if a program of interest has hired a lot of new professors recently, which suggests that the school has funding and potentially more openings for PhD students. \n\nIf you do decide to apply to top programs, make sure the alignment is clear in your SOP, and try not to take it as a personal failing if you end up not being selected. We all want to believe in a meritocracy with a fair and systematic process, but the reality is that professors making these decisions are just people and the system we use is sometimes arbitrary or downright stupid. We make mistakes, we overlook good candidates for stupid reasons or because of personal biases, we spend less time on applicants describing research interests far from our own fields, we forget to read the last 2 applications on the pile of 100s, etc. I know candidates often want to know \"what was wrong with my application that I didn't get selected?\" but this is the wrong way to think about it because there may have been nothing wrong with your application. In reality, it was just that something in someone else's profile that made them stand out to that particularly professor, such as a letter of recommendation from the right person. "

Aside from your major reqs (which you have to declare after 2 years), you can take any courses in anything.

Since people only take classes because they want to be there, it leads to a much more engaged classroom. Collaboration is a huge thing - since everyone is doing their own thing and following their true interests, competitiveness is pretty nonexistent. There’s a robust advising system in place due to all the choice so that students still stay on track. The tour was cancelled, so we had a student panel instead.

You are either going to love the Open curriculum and Brown, or hate it. There is no in-between. These people seemed… so happy. Two were premeds (one PLME), one was prelaw, but they all seemed happy. I’ll paraphrase the PLME guy’s “why brown”: “I went to a very competitive high school, and I was doing all the things, running the race, top of my class, etc. Then I had to decide: did I want four more years of the same? Or did I want to be happy? I chose happy. \\[talked about his time at Brown for a while\\] Oh yeah, and I am happy.” Other premed guy was really happy too - they all were. As a girl said, “Here, your success does not depend on someone else’s failure.” And get this - they all still had insane ECs and involvements, research (80% of undergrads do research!), etc. Another girl explained this, and she said that since here, they were free to explore their true passions, all the other things they did WERE their hobbies, their social time, what they did for fun. They all truly loved everything they did. I truly love what I do in HS, but I definitely want to be surrounded by a community of people like that too, instead of all my depressed HS peers. And I want to be happy. Since everyone is so busy doing their own thing, it’s a really diverse space - everyone’s always doing their thing and nobody gets judged for it. They can take any class P/F, so grades aren’t really an issue, and they have like an 81% med school admit rate, and \\~80% to law school. Their students end up being competitive applicants for grad/professional programs despite being in this environment (or maybe because of it), and I think that’s poetic and beautiful. I ultimately decided against ED (sticking by my first ED choice - the polar opposite of Brown) because it’s like they say. You can take the kid out of the gunner environment, but you can’t take the gunner out the kid. Or something like that.\n\nSurrounding Area: Similar to Yale in every way (see Yale for more details). City that isn’t too big or too small - with enough bustle to be a city, but not enough to be overwhelming. Gapped row houses. Maybe a tad more crowded around campus? Student panel said the city itself is very artistic and creative, and has the most cafes per capita out of any city (didn’t fact check). Weather is also good - you get to experience all 4 seasons for sure. Basically - weather, art, and food.\n\nCampus Tour: We didn’t have a formal tour, but still wandered around campus, so here’s my thoughts of the campus. Again, it’s very much like Yale, maybe smaller. Roads run through the campus - it’s not a bubble. But it’s not overwhelming either - a nice Goldilocks zone. The med school buildings are pretty integrated into the undergrad stuff - we walked by a bunch of labs, undergrad buildings, and med school buildings all together. So there’s no clear separation of campuses like UPenn.\n\nKey Takeaways: Open Curriculum works, makes the environment way less competitive/stressful while still preparing students really well, not just academically but with ECs/research too. They genuinely seem happy. More so than anywhere else. A space where you’re free to be yourself, where they don’t expect you to have your life figured out at 17/18 - just your passions.\n\n**Columbia:**\n\nInfo Session: Didn’t have a formal info session, but a lot of what the tour guide yapped about was stuff that is usually covered in the info session (minus the admissions part), so I’ll put it here. 12000 in College (Arts & Sciences), 4000 in Engineering. Core curriculum for both, though College is more broad and Engineering is more applicable to engineering. Theme/mission for engineering is “engineering for humanity” - serving by applying knowledge to the real world. Lots of design projects in engineering. There are 200+ research centers, and labs are required to hold spots open for undergrads. Cold emailing works and usually the first one is a “yes.” There is a PE req and a swim test (for College only). There is guaranteed housing for all 4 years - 90% stay on campus. Everyone is assigned a general academic advisor who oversees and is the main point of contact, a major-specific advisor once you declare your major after the 1st year, and a pre-professional advisor for anyone going into grad or professional school. There is usually no class on Fridays, which are more of an “internship” day - lots of students get internships with the big firms like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, finance firms, etc. based in NYC - an upside of the location. Columbia students and classes (especially the core classes, which average 16-18 students) have a lot of philosophical discourse.\n\nSurrounding Area: I LOVE NYC. Baltimore and Philly were some other big towns I saw, and I gotta say I did not love those (especially Philly). But NYC was just… such a change from what I’m used to, in a good way. It’s relatively clean (there aren’t heaps of trash in the streets), and there are so many people everywhere, doing the most random things. Anyone from homeless people to businessmen to people jogging back and forth in front of a block. Everything is so close together and there are so many things everywhere. Definitely no row houses here like Baltimore and Philly - just apartments. I saw a subway for the first time!! (Though I didn’t get to go on it). I will say though, the drivers are terrible. Everybody jaywalks, and it’s impossible to drive past a crosswalk because there’s always someone crossing it when they’re not supposed to. And you also can’t go 30 seconds without someone cutting you off (and then they have the audacity to honk at you…) Traffic is also absolutely terrible, made worse by how aggressive the drivers are. But overall, I love the feel of NYC. Where I live, there’s a sense of isolation, because you’re always alone and everything is so far away. But with so many people here, always driving and walking somewhere, you’re never alone. There’s a sense that you’re a part of something bigger, something better, and I love that. Also, I don’t think you can beat NYC in terms of internship opportunities and industry.\n\nCampus Tour: It’s a decently sized campus, but it’s majestic and grand. Not in an old crumbly castle way though - in a regal way. Like you’re looking at something historical, but instead of looking depressingly old, it looks mighty significant. I really love the architecture here. They have different buildings for all the subjects - the Engineering building has the different Engineering branches on different floors. Campus is definitely somewhat of a bubble and not very integrated into NYC, but it’s right outside the gates. Overall I really love the campus here.\n\nKey Takeaways: NYC!! Nice for a large city, bustling, lots of internship opportunities due to the location. Campus is a great size and architecture is exactly the kind I like. High emphasis on core curriculum and getting exposure to lots of different fields via deep philosophical discourse to draw practical connections even if they’re not related to your major. Serving and having real life applications are big themes.\n\n**Harvard:**\n\nInfo Session: So, I actually really enjoyed the student panel at Brown (obviously I’d take a tour over a student panel, but it was still really helpful). Harvard was the only college to offer a student panel during the actual admissions info session (JHU had one student, but she didn’t talk much, while Harvard had 2 and the AO constantly asked them to talk about their experiences with X or Y). There’s 17 freshman houses, but they all eat at Annenberg hall (the Hogwarts looking thing). Then there’s 12 houses for all your other years, each with their own dining halls. 7:1 student to faculty, avg class size of 12 (though my tour guide said the intro lectures can be like 600-800, but they always split large lectures into sections of <30). You apply to the university and declare your major after 1.5 years. They really pride themselves on offering a liberal arts education and requiring students to take classes in a bunch of areas to be well rounded and knowledgeable about the world around them. So for application purposes, they want you to have interests and strong points in your profile, but not have ALL your ECs/interests be in CS or something. They have $7M in undergrad research funding annually, and there’s more research opportunities than students. They LOVE that phrase - 3 separate people quipped it to me when I asked them about research (felt kinda cultish lowkey). They also really loved to present Harvard as “choose your own adventure” - they said they don’t expect you to know what you’re going to do for sure (one of the guys on the student panel went in as a CS major and is now a senior in anthropology). They want you to explore things you’ve never done and keep doing them for the community you find. Oh, and they’re REALLY big on people, diversity, etc. - they kept saying the people make Harvard, that everyone is very different here which creates an interesting and connected community. So I guess if you and someone else have the same stats and similar ECs, don’t expect to both get in. Alumni interviews are offered on availability, but are highly recommended.\n\nSurrounding Area: Boston is BIG (as in, it took me an hour and a half to get from the Boston suburbs to Harvard). Cambridge is definitely a city. Maybe not compared to Boston, but definitely compared to the suburbs. Not really any row houses, mainly apartments, but they looked bigger than the ones in NYC. The streets were nice - not pristine, but much nicer than NYC/Philly. Not having homeless people follow you for 2 blocks also helps (true story). I think it’s right in the middle - if you’re from the city it won’t feel like being in the middle of nowhere, and if you’re from the suburbs or a rural area it shouldn’t be too overwhelming. Also, I just gotta shout out the gelato place at Harvard. They make rose shaped (!) gelato (!!) and you can pick as many flavors as you want (!!!) and each flavor becomes a rose petal (!!!!). I didn’t know about the multiple flavor thing until it was too late, but even with one flavor it was really good. The actual gelato was amazing too (I got pistachio). AND you get a free ice cream macaron. Not really free, just included in the price, but it was a nice surprise. The $13 bill was not.\n\nCampus Tour: It was the closest you can get to being an isolated bubble without actually being an isolated bubble. There were a few streets that ran through it, but for the most part there were huge pockets of Harvard-ness. Just a bit of the city was integrated - enough to have food places nearby, but not enough to feel like you’re not on a college campus. Also, the new SEAS campus is in Boston (a 40min walk/15min drive) from the main campus with the old SEAS buildings, so if you’re in engineering/cs/applied math you’ll have to shuttle back and forth a lot, which is kinda a downside. Other than that it was a pretty moderate campus in every other way - I really can’t see someone hating all 100% of it.\n\nKey Takeaways: You can literally drown in research here, THE GELATO IS TO DIE FOR, really great middle zone of city without as much bustle and campus integration into the city.\n\n**Johns Hopkins:**\n\nInfo Session: Got there like 15 mins early, a general video played that showed all the students having fun at different events. An AO gave the info session (not my regional AO sadly). Speech was very rehearsed but touched on everything you’d expect. Key things: 6:1 student to faculty ratio; 60% of students are from EDI/EDII pools; 85% of students do research/internships; 85% acceptance to med school (woo!) and 97% to law school. AO heavily emphasized the school mission - something about creating knowledge for the world. As someone who is gonna go into academia, this was super inspiring and really made me feel like the mission aligned with my ideas. They care about creating knowledge (if you wanna make a startup or go into research or have done this already), and sharing it by bettering your community (if you’ve had an impact in your community already). Also they offer lots of advising - general academic advising, specific advising for your major(s) and minor(s), career advising, etc. They emphasized that they don’t want you to have your life mapped out and know what your end goal is and exactly how you’re gonna get there - they just want you to know what you’re passionate about and what you want to do in the world, and have an idea about the paths you could take while being open to multiple paths/opportunities.\n\nSurrounding Area: Directly surrounding area looks kinda dangerous and run down, ngl. I live in suburbia so it may just be any big town that looks like that, but this isn’t the kinda place where I would feel 100% comfortable all the time. Lots of row houses (again - suburbia - we don’t have these! They look nice and quaint). The area around the hotel I stayed at (15 min drive away) was actually VERY nice - lots of people out and about, no graffiti, bunch of kids and adults playing soccer, basketball, tennis, etc. outside, definitely a place I would want to live in. \n\nCampus Tour: Actual campus was very nice and safe, didn’t look too old/run down and had some modern touches. Nice and spacious, with lots of quads. Definitely a traditional college campus - was very isolated from Baltimore and looked nothing like outside campus, like a little Hopkins bubble. They have a very neat gym/rec center. We went into one of the (lab?) buildings and there were a bunch of research posters on the walls. I read a few - looks like it’s pretty common for students to collaborate with profs here and at other unis. Student giving the tour spoke about how it was pretty easy to get research opportunities through good ole cold emailing and how profs were receptive to working with students (yayy). Also lots of talk about the collaborative environment - a parent asked about how competitive JHU was and like 3 students said everyone here helps each other. They genuinely seemed very nice - slightly introverted people who can yap for days.\n\nKey Takeaways: Hopkins be hopkinsing with that med school acceptance rate, huge emphasis on research and doing stuff for others (community), huge emphasis & resources for undergrad research, Baltimore isn’t as dangerous as everyone seems to say (maybe it is in some areas, but definitely not all).\n\n**MIT:**\n\nInfo Session: This has gotta be my favorite one by far (followed by Princeton and Yale in case anyone was wondering). This guy didn’t take questions, but if he did, I would have asked him about his public speaking skills, cause DAMN. Guy knew how to give a presentation. He was funny and amicable from the beginning. At the beginning when he was asking where everyone was from, what portion of the room was applicants/parents/counselors, etc. (stuff most AOs did), he asked if there were any alumni in the room. One girl raised her hand, and he said, “welcome home.” At MIT, they foster innovation and hands-on experience, and really revel in the whole nerdy scientist/engineer community. Their undergrad research opportunity program is the primary source of internships (in other schools they have similar programs, but most people get theirs through cold emailing). They do require you to take 8 humanities classes and 4 PE classes. 1st semester is Pass/No Record, and 2nd semester is A/B/C/No Record (so you can’t fail for the first year). REALLY INTERESTING STATS NO OTHER SCHOOL GAVE: upon graduation, 52% join the workforce (average starting salary of $115,461) and 43% go on to grad school. You apply to MIT, not to a major - in fact, 70-75% of applicants indicate interest in CS when applying, so you know most people don’t stick with their intentions. All undergrads take a similar set of 1st year courses, after which they declare their major. The AO then talked a bit about the separate application portal and how they use it because they’re looking for a specific set of students and the common app doesn’t help them find those. That’s why they don’t ask for a personal statement (but rather short essay responses), only have 4 activity slots, etc. He says they want to know why you think MIT is the best (what resources you’d use, professors, etc.) in your reason for applying, rather than just stating it’s the best. Interviews are assigned at random, but the tips he gave for the interview were to do your research on MIT, what professors you’d want to intern under, what programs you’d do, etc. and to bring a brag sheet/resume to either give to your interviewer if they ask, or to look at if your mind goes blank.\n\nSurrounding Area: See Harvard part for stuff on the city of Cambridge. The part of Cambridge that MIT is in is nicer than the part Harvard is in (sorry). Harvard’s area is nice and all, decently clean and without much (or any) trash in the streets. MIT area of Cambridge is PRISTINE. Like it literally could not be more clean and neat. MIT also has “MIT bubbles” like Harvard (see Harvard part), but it’s a bit more integrated into the city than Harvard. There were buildings for a bunch of big firms right near MIT’s campus. I walked into some research center that had a display on the 1st floor that was open to the public (because the topic of the research interests me) and walked out with the contact of one of the researchers there and a tentative virtual internship offer. So when they say MIT has insane research opportunities, it’s also the surrounding area.\n\nCampus Tour: Everything has a VERY modern look. There are no castle-like buildings, just concrete, glass, etc. Some of the buildings are older and some are newer, but none give medieval vibes like some other schools. Campus was also very very neat and pristine and clean. Not that much grass/quads though. I also gotta say, MIT must be on something because my MIT tour guide was also the best tour guide of any tour. He spoke about the MIT experience and campus life through stories and anecdotes, and was a really good storyteller. Some were his personal stories, some were MIT classics like the police car hack. It was an interesting way to approach a tour, since most tour guides just rattle off info and maybe a bit of their experience. This guy told stories, which I think explained the MIT vibe better than anything else could have.\n\nKey Takeaways: An absolute haven for nerdy engineers or stem people, every bit the stem community they market it as. The people are creative, innovative, their eyes sparkle when they talk about MIT. Campus and area are absolutely impeccable. This is kind of obvious, but research (and opportunities) are top tier.\n\n**Princeton:**\n\nInfo Session: A director of something admissions related (?) gave the info session. Confident and a really great speaker - not a rehearsed speech, and not an awkward one either. Just the right balance of jokes and passion to make you feel like it was a conversation rather than a presentation. Very undergrad focused school, ¾ of classes have 20 students or less, 5:1 student to faculty ratio, ALL classes taught by faculty, which includes 12 Nobel prize winners, some of whom even teach intro level classes. There’s a senior thesis req so everyone is required to do research, and most undergrads do research outside of that - profs are very open to working with students. Asked my tour guide about the ease of pubs, and he said it was pretty common for students to publish here. Cannot double major. 25% of the students are in engineering, the rest are in the regular arts & sciences program. You don’t apply to a major, just to a BSE or BA track (which you can then switch anytime before major declarations). Somewhere between Core and Open curriculums - you have to take courses within a certain focus area, but you get to pick which courses. Talked about the VERY strong alumni network a lot. 84% med school acceptance rate (lost by 1% to Hopkins lol), and 75% of undergrads eventually go on to higher education. They focus a lot on community and service and how you’ll contribute there. Also have a graded written paper req when you apply. At the Q&A portion, this girl had NO shame (I could never) and threw all these questions at the AO - about the eating clubs, how Princeton was handling political protests, etc. The AO answered the questions very gracefully and tactfully without actually answering them.\n\nSurrounding Area: SUBURBIA. Just like my old town back home… Honestly, it was really, really nice and safe and pretty. Lots of wild animals too, I saw a bunch of deer and foxes. Lots of houses, not many apartments or anything like that (though I assume they exist). Campus was somewhat of a bubble but it was big enough to still give the suburban feel, so it didn’t really feel like a bubble.\n\nCampus Tour: VERY big campus for a school that size, especially considering it has a set campus that’s separate from the city. But it’s still walkable and has shuttles that run back and forth. Expect lots of walking though - I’m a fan of long walks, so this isn’t an issue for me. Campus was very nice and clean, and had a lot of research peeps buzzing around. The labs were all open, and I got to trespass inside (shh) to check them out. Honestly, this is every researcher’s dream. There is SO much equipment, so many different labs, so many people… I will note that they use chalkboards, not whiteboards, which is a bit weird but to each their own. They’re also working on building a new Engineering building, which is HUGE and looks great.\n\nKey Takeaways: Suburban, small and undergrad focused, RESEARCH, sprawling campus with a nice, calm vibe.\n\n**UPenn:**\n\nInfo Session: The AO who gave this session was a more soft spoken man. Definitely didn’t feel as rehearsed. Even though there’s 10,000 students, most classes are taught by faculty and large lecture hall classes are rare. They were the only school that focused a lot on their founder (Ben Franklin), so taking a grateful and humble approach to the application will probably be an extra plus here. Said Ben Franklin embodied the school - interdisciplinary and exploring different fields & being an inventor/innovator in society by being the first to do something. They’re also really big on community - some classes incorporate community service projects, and they have lots of support systems for minorities. You can take classes at the graduate schools as an undergrad. They didn’t really have a “key thing we’re looking for in your app” - just the generic stuff. Interview is not considered in the admissions process and is purely for the applicant to get to know more about UPenn. I talked to a few students who had done research after the session - they all said getting research was super easy and the professors were very eager to work with students (9 in 10 profs had ongoing research), and that getting research even as a freshman was easy. Pubs are doable if you put in the effort.\n\nSurrounding Area: Again, this may just be me not being used to the city vibe, but there was lots of trash on the streets. A bunch of crumbling buildings and row houses, except instead of looking quaint like in the area of Baltimore I was in, they just looked run down. What I did like was that everything was kind of within the same area, from Penn Medicine and a few hospitals to the different graduate schools to the undergrad schools.\n\nCampus Tour: The campus is integrated into the city. It’s not one space for all the buildings like Hopkins. Also, each undergrad school has its own building (though you can take classes across any of the schools). The buildings aren’t in one isolated UPenn bubble - they’re within one area, but in the middle of Philly, with streets and stores between them. There are areas to the campus that feel less like a city - there’s a walkway with a bunch of trees, and in some locations you can barely tell you’re in a big city with a bustling street a short walk away. If you’re looking for something with a mix of big city vibes and nature feels, and don’t mind a campus that’s a bit integrated into the city, this campus might be right for you. I only got to go into Wharton, but I roamed around a bit - they only have group study rooms, but you can just go inside one alone which kinda defeats the purpose. The rooms are very nice, and so are the classrooms - everything looks clean and new. They have whiteboards.\n\nKey Takeaways: Definitely embraces the city instead of isolating the campus from it (cough cough Hopkins). Still manages to incorporate some nature. Great undergrad research opportunities. Don’t seem to want a specific “type” of student over others, aside from the things mentioned in the info session section (which are pretty basic things any college looks for).\n\n**Yale:**\n\nInfo Session: WAS HELD BY MY REGIONAL AO!!! As someone from an obscure area, I was sooo excited. He was really open about the admissions process, and truly believed fully in holistic admissions, inclusion, diversity, looking at context, etc. He seemed so genuine when he talked about it, and emphasized all these things A LOT. Said he has 2 questions he asks for admitting each student: How is the student going to contribute to Yale’s community? And: How is the student going to make use of Yale’s resources? Basically, he’s looking for how you’ve used resources in the past to grow, and what you’ve done in your community. He said, “Yale is not only a place of transformation, but a place to become what you’ve always been.” He looks for students who will transform in Yale in some way by using the resources, but also those who will use the resources to do what they’ve always wanted to do. For example, he mentioned how he’d always been afraid of public speaking, but at Yale he realized he’d always been a storyteller and started doing improv. They’re also really big on curiosity, spark, and passion - your unique story. You apply to the uni as a whole, not a major/college. Interviews are only if they want more info (all about that context/holistic admissions) - tons of people get admitted with and without them. And they’re looking for anecdotes specifically in the LOR. My tour guide actually talked more about Yale specifically than the AO (who only talked about financial aid and admissions - typically they talk about the school too). You can take up to 2 years to declare your major (but you can do it earlier). Yale is between Core and Open (like JHU and Princeton) - you have to take courses with a certain theme, but can pick which course you want to take that fits that theme. They have combined majors because double majoring is an option but hard - so instead of getting a major in math and a major in cs, you can get a single major in “math and cs.” There’s a 6:1 student to faculty ratio, with not many large lectures. Lectures are always professor led, but for larger lectures you might also have a TA for discussion groups (prof always has office hours tho).\n\nSurrounding Area: It was somewhat of a city (not suburbs like Princeton), but not as big/bustling as Philly, Baltimore, NYC, Boston, etc. Bigger than my city back home, and it definitely had a city feel, but not really a bustling feel. There were lots of these houses that were kinda like row houses, but with a tiny bit of spacing between them instead of being all smooshed together. \n\nCampus Tour: My tour guide had SUCH a competitive gunner personality, and was just such an ambitious, determined, knowing-where-you’re-headed leader. We also share the same first name, and honestly, that is who I aspire to be. Unlike Princeton/JHU, the campus was not a separate bubble. Roads did run through it. There was a whole road lined with STEM buildings (science hill?). Everything was very integrated though (unlike Columbia, where the engineering building was separate). Still, the campus was pretty nice. It had a lot of the old fashioned castle vibe, but everything was super neat (lawns, pathways, etc.) and I really liked the layout. \n\nKey Takeaways: Really nice Goldilocks town and school, truly values holistic process and background/context (maybe that’s just my AO tho). Cares a lot about diversity - of everything, socioeconomics included (they spent so much of the presentation on financial aid - longer than any other school). Lots of places say these things, but here at Yale it felt most genuine."

    "body": "just as a general statement to anyone who reads this: if you are aiming to practice/study medicine within the U.S., you have to come to terms with the fact that like many things, medicine has been and will continue to be inherently political. paying attention to politics is not only important (especially right now) to general life, but these things impact us, our ability to attain our goals, our patient populations, and the health of our country. \n\nif you’re aiming to be in this career field in the year 2025, there should not be anymore “oh yeah i don’t really care about politics” or “yeah that doesn’t affect me”. it is an immense privilege to remain naive about politics because regardless of if you do politics, politics will without a doubt eventually always do you. physicians in a social hierarchy have a position of power, our leadership and advocacy for our patients does not end when we step out of the hospital or exam room because advocating for a better healthcare system is in fact patient advocacy. some of the most important patient advocacy we can do is when we form community and speak up. \n\nas is, the current bill (HR 1) in the senate will severely limit the ability for people to see medical school as attainable by sunsetting graduate plus loans and capping unsubsidized graduate loans. for those who may be low income or non traditional or have faced hardships may not even qualify for private loans due to required credit checks. not everyone has a good credit score, income, or someone in their corner to agree to cosign on something they might & can negatively impact their credit score as well. are private loans options when they cut the grad loans and cap the unsubsidized loans? sure. are they options for everyone like federal loans? absolutely no. not to mention predatory APRs that will inhibit payback on principal loans. \ni haven’t even touched on how much we will feel from the major changes to PSLF and repayment restructuring - it will be felt and it will most likely affect you unless you are lucky enough to never have to take out loans for medical schooling. \n\nnot only does this bill seek to cut pathways to attain our goals, but it is estimated that $900+ million will be gutted from medicaid. this ALSO affects you and your future patients and patient populations and who you treat as a doctor and what hospitals you can work at. many in elderly patient populations use medicaid to help them with covering their nursing home stays. many pregnant women and children and those with legitimate disabilities will lose care they desperately need. and i am not even talking about proposed cuts to medicare such as the cutting of the medicare physician payment relief program that will jeopardize practices and care for those over the age of 65. \n\nHHS also just gutted the advisory committee on immunization practices, or ACIP, by firing all of the highly qualified non partisan physician experts and replaced only 8 slots with many who have directly threatened one of the biggest public health innovations we have ever had: vaccines. practicing medicine IS weighing the risks and benefits for your patients and talking them through it to make sure they’re know that they’re choosing the most educated decision for themselves, including vaccinations. to sow public distrust by utilizing your expert title does more harm than good and isn’t adherent to evidence-based practices. \n\nER physicians cannot fully treat their pregnant patient populations to the best of their ability at this time due to non specific reproductive right laws within states because they fear repercussions of lawsuit/jail time. EMTALA guidance regarding emergency care of pregnant patients was just recently rolled back. OB/GYN providers are being sued/facing extradition cross country for prescribing a medication that they counseled their patients on and they both decided was the best thing for the patient at that time, even if they practice in a state where this is legal. a Georgia woman was kept alive via life support against familial wishes because she was carrying a 9 week old fetus at the time of declared brain death. \n\ntldr; as it stands today, this career path is directly political. these things are real and they affect you, your future patients, your communities now and in the future, and more. you should care because it matters. \n\nyour voice also matters; continue to call your representatives and speak on issues that affect you, medicine or not medicine related. including reps that you think are already aware of these things but you feel are not getting advocated for. apps like 5 Calls can be a tool for you. your representatives serve you, not the other way around.

So if anything I learned during my three years in the trenches can help someone who is where I was two years ago, then I want to share it.\n\nI have a pretty big sample size of schools, and by the end of it, I had done most of the typical premed experiences. I don’t really consider myself a special applicant with any sort of X factor, so I feel like my advice might be more generalizable than people who had super high MCAT scores, some crazy backstory, or other wild variable that helped them get in. I’m really just a dude who wants to be a doctor because I like science and want to help people (don’t put that on a personal statement).\n\n**Background on how my cycles went**\n\nStats (same all three cycles): GPA 3.7 with a 4.0 post-bac, 514 MCAT School background: Majored in Econ and decided to go to med school 2 months before I graduated college in 2019. That’s really where my application began—before that, I had essentially just focused on making the best grades I could, aside from a few short summer jobs. No prestigious internships or anything crazy.\n\nI minored in astronomy, so I had already taken a few science classes, but most of my prereqs came from my post-bac program. I did undergrad at UNC and my post-bac at American University in DC.\n\nFirst cycle:\n\nFirst time I applied, I felt pretty good about my application. I had pretty decent stats, 10 months working as a scribe, had just started working as a CNA, and had some volunteering experience. I had some great mentors giving me advice and definitely did my research before applying. I thought I had good writing, applied early in the cycle, and stuck to schools that don’t favor in-state applicants too much.\n\nUltimately, I got 3 interviews and no acceptances. I applied to about 30 schools. I was bummed but not too discouraged because I knew a lot of people don’t get in on their first try.\n\nSecond cycle:\n\nFelt really good going into this cycle. I had worked as a CNA for a year, which I loved and wrote about super passionately. I really thought this would show through since I’d been told getting into med school was not about checking boxes—you need to do things you’re passionate about. I also had more volunteering experience this cycle.\n\nEnded up getting only 2 interviews and no acceptances, so I did worse, which made no sense to me. I applied to about 35 schools.\n\nThird cycle:\n\nI was stressing bad because I felt like I had been doing all the right things and working harder than I ever had before but still couldn’t get in anywhere. My MCAT was going to expire after this cycle, and I wasn’t sure I could go through that again. Also got the lowest quartile on Casper (can rant about Casper for a while, but we’ll hold off).\n\nSome days I would just wake up at 3:00 AM with heart palpitations or my mind racing, and I’d be like, “Well, I guess I just have to start my day.” It sucked. I held nothing back this cycle and applied to an absurd 68 schools.\n\nI added a research experience (no pubs or poster) and had around 100 hours volunteering at a free clinic. Amazingly, I got 18 interviews, so many I had to start turning them down, which I never thought would happen. Of the 9 I attended, I got 7 acceptances and 2 waitlists.\n\n**What made the difference between the second and third cycle?**\n\nFirst off, I applied to DO schools for the first time and had a lot of success, so just broadening my school selection helped. But I also had a huge jump in MD success, which I think speaks to the changes I made.\n\n*Check every box*\n\n- When I was doing my research for applying, I came away with the impression that med school admissions was supposed to be holistic and not about checking boxes. So instead of doing scientific research, I put most of my time into being a CNA, something I was passionate about and that aligned with my reasons for studying medicine.\n- But saying med school isn’t about checking boxes is really only half true. I only saw wide-spanning success when I maxed out all parts of the rubric. Me being a CNA—no matter how passionate I was—just wasn’t enough to overcome my lack of research and underserved volunteering.\n- When schools decide who to interview and accept, I can say with pretty high confidence they use some kind of rubric. Anytime you’re being graded by a rubric you better have all categories accounted for. I don’t have a copy of a rubric and don’t know exactly what each school uses, but you really want to cover all your bases.\n- Doing research didn’t change my motivation for medicine at all. I loved my lab, and the research they were doing was cool—but I essentially just pipetted for a year. That’s the game though.\n\n*Big experiences you need to hit:*\n\nStrong clinical experience (CNA and EMT are the strongest IMO. Medical assistant also works. I have mixed feeling about being a scribe, but plenty of people get into med school scribing. I was both a scribe and a CNA and found having a hands-on experience where you’re actually talking to patients way more impactful and way easier to write about. Is being a scribe even a thing right now with AI???)\n- Underserved volunteering (non-clinical is actually encouraged, but if you do clinical volunteering, try to do it at a free clinic)\n- Research\n- Shadowing (I think it’s dumb, but just do it—it might be part of a school’s rubric)\n\n*Don’t waste time on things you can’t write or speak passionately about*\n\nChecking the boxes is not enough—but it’s the first step. Next step is making sure the boxes you’re checking actually matter.\n\nOne of my volunteer experiences was Red Cross blood drives. I had 200+ hours volunteering where I just checked names off a list. Super hard to write about. Contrast that with volunteering as a medical assistant at a free clinic, where every shift brought a new story and I interacted with patients every day. That experience practically wrote itself—same with being a CNA.\n\nSome of my experiences were a complete waste of time, but I did them because they were easy. Don’t do that. Do stuff that’s hard and makes you grow—it will be worth it. You’ll be able to talk about it passionately and become a better person because of it.\n\n*Make your experiences into a narrative (you can do this retroactively)*\n\nFor some reason admissions committees are addicted to the idea of a narrative. If you’re like me and don’t have some crazy story or special reason for wanting to do medicine, this can seem hard. But you can actually craft this narrative retroactively.\n\nExample: When I got my research job, I applied to every research job in North Carolina I could find that I was remotely qualified for—over 120. Only one gave me an offer, it was a lab researching an HIV vaccine. Since I only got one offer, I didn’t really have any choice on which job to take. Me not having any other option is one story I could’ve told med schools, but that’s not a very good story. Instead, I framed it like this:\n\nAs a CNA and volunteer MA in my hometown, I saw how much my community struggles to accept vaccine science and often distrusts medicine. How do I know vaccines are safe? What goes into making them? I wanted to take an active role in vaccine research so I could better serve as a liaison between my hometown and the scientific community.\n\nWay better story than “this was the only job that got back to me.” Even though both are true.\n\nTry to connect all your experiences—even retroactively. Life is unpredictable and sometimes you have to do experiences just simply because they’re the only option, but you can be creative and craft a logical connection or narrative after the fact, and it looks way better than dumping a bunch of random experiences on your app.\n\n*Interviewing*\n\nInterview stage I had a high interview success rate my third cycle and was either waitlisted or accepted at every school I interviewed at. My biggest advice here is don’t focus on “being yourself.” Focus on knowing yourself. By this point in the process, I had written about myself so much, and put a lot of work into my secondaries in primary application over three years. I knew my story so well, and I had countless anecdotes to back it up.\n\nMy formula:\n\nState your opinion then back it up with an experience.\n\nEvery time you have an ethical dilemma, hard day at work, or meaningful patient interaction—write it down. One well-known story can answer 50% of interview questions just by tweaking which part of it you emphasize.\n\nIf you’re doing experiences that are meaningful and actually making you grow, you’ll have plenty to talk about.\n\nLean into your interests outside of medicine. Be specific. Most interviews are predictable, some are super random — but if you know yourself, you’ll adapt.\n\nSometimes they just want to know have you thought about things critically. One of my interviews spent the first 15 minutes talking about how speaking English allows you to travel almost anywhere and still find people who understand you, whereas other languages don’t. I did that interview from Japan at 3AM in a T-shirt and gym shorts because I had planned that trip for late March and then got an interview invite on the flight over there. That topic made up 1/4 of my interview and it was just a random thing I found interesting as I was traveling. I got into that school.\n\n**School selection**\n\nWhere you apply matters so much. On my third cycle, I had a massive spreadsheet with every med school in MSAR and their out-of-state interview percentages.\n\nBut also, even with all the growth I had on my third cycle, I still received 45 rejections! A lot of this process is luck and who reads your app—but you can still stack the odds in your favor.\n\n**Why should you listen to me?**\n\nI was down bad. I was rethinking my whole life. If I didn’t get in, I was maybe gonna try to go to a Caribbean school, but I don’t know. My whole path was up in the air. I really know what it’s like to not be able to get into med school. I easily received over 100 rejection emails and was probably rejected from 70 different schools in total. That’s an embarrassingly high number, but I did learn A LOT through all the rejections and had some great mentors along the way.\n\n**Closing**\n\nI have so much more advice I could give on med school admissions and so many things I could rant about but I won’t make this post 20 pages long.\n\nIf this helped anyone, I’d be happy to rant about other topics or even make a video going through the specifics of my application and why I think I was successful at certain schools. I have no shortage of rants. I lived and breathed this for three years. I truly wish I didn’t know as much about admissions as I do.\n\nIf you’re struggling to get in, I know how heartbreaking it is to work incredibly hard for something and fail.\n\nFor the longest time, I thought getting into med school defined me. I put all my self-worth into whether or not I could get accepted. Now that I’m in med school, I realize how dumb that was.\n\nIf you really want this, don’t quit. Give it your all. Failure is growth. But don’t ever attach your self-worth to this process. It has so many flaws, and admissions committees are full of contradictions.\n\nMost importantly medicine is not everything—not even close. Find fulfillment in your life right now. Don’t attach it to an arbitrary goal or you will never find happiness. I’m still trying to master that myself."

    "body": "I got a 1570 on the SAT this june.\n\nI had gotten a 1530 last summer and my dad was NOT happy with that score, so he made me sign up for SAT...after SAT...insisting that I must score 1550+. He made me drop EVERYTHING to study for the SAT. I have a lot of ECs and APs and dropping all this for a stupid test took a huge hit. Dad made me skip a week of school to grind for the SAT and took the April SAT. Got an abysmal score. Was grounded and sent to the backrooms to study yet again.\n\ntook the june SAT, felt okay about it, and got my result two weeks later when I was at an international competition that i'd been grinding for 6+ months and 2000+ miles away from home. After I had competed, I checked my score and practically fell to my knees with joy. called my parents about it and they literally could not care less. I won 1st place at that international competition (hell yeah) and went home.\n\nmy dad looked at me and said, \"well, it would be a shame if you'd done all that \\*fucking\\* work and not gotten anything.\" yeah. that's it. nothing about my sat score that he'd spent the last year agonizing me about, nothing about my project, just nothing.\n\nthat very SAME night, my dad physically dragged me out of bed while I was sleeping and screamed at me for 2 hours (until 1:30 a.m.). why? because I was shadowing a doctor next day and the shoes I was going to wear \"triggered him.\" My faded pink Nikes that were going to be covered by my suit were going to \"embarrass him.\" He then shoved a pair of skinny jeans (jeans are a huge NO in shadowing doctors) and my 10 y/o brother's blazer. Guess learning that you got a 1570 just 24 hours prior doesn't grant you immunity from his anger.\n\nMy mere existence has seemed to \"trigger\" my dad this past year. There is ALWAYS something wrong with what I'm doing. And his constant anger, the constant fights, screaming matches, are all just killing me.\n\nWhen I turned 17, I didn't have time to celebrate, as I had a shitton of exams around the corner and projects to do. My mom insisted on going for a family birthday dinner, so we went. at the resturaunt, my dad started yelling my brother because he refused to eat the food he ordered and promptly left the resturaunt and drove home, leaving everyone else at the restaurant. never apologized. on his birthday, he asked why i didn't have anything for him. i referenced this particular instance and he got really mad and said I was \"playing victim\" and was just an unforgettable brat that was \"ungrateful\" for everything he does.\n\nI am an artist, and a damn good one at that. It's my biggest spikes for college apps. The day junior year ended, I went home, happy that i'd finally get to paint for the first time in weeks, as I'd been busy with my 6 AP classes and whatnot. I thought I'd be able to do this in peace, since my grades were really fucking good (lowest grade was a 97 in AP Physics w/ no grade inflation) and my parents obviously knew how much I'd been studying (was up till 3 studying for like the entire semester), so i'd figure they wouldn't have any problem with it.\n\nI asked my mom if she could take me to the art store (guess who doesn't have a license) so I could buy a few paints that I ran out of. She tells my dad, and he LOST his shit. like, this resulted in the worst fight we've ever had. he went into my room and physically dragged out my easel and threatened to rip apart my paintings.\n\nBasically, he didn't want me to do art. At all. He said I should focus on my college apps. not my stupid and frivolous paintings.\n\nThis is where I got extremely fed up, especially since I was planning to submit an arts supplement to all of my top schools. I fought with him. I had spent the year grinding to the point where my own hair was falling out and the least I could do was spent two hours a day painting during the summer?? somehow, this devolved into him telling me I could go ahead and \"k!ll myself\" or he could just kick me out of the house or he should leave. Ever since then, he's been joking about kicking me out when I'm 18. H\n\nThese fights continued over the summer. I avoid him like the plague, and he takes the few instances he can catch me to tell me what I'm doing wrong in life. Now, right before I'm starting to apply for colleges, he told me he won't pay a single cent if I don't get into a T20 or an ivy league. Well, shit. Guess I'll start applying for scholarships. I got selected as finalists for a couple of smaller scholarships. instead of being happy, he just told me that my head was \"always in the clouds\" and I get too easily distracted??????\n\nMy research (that my dad insisted I drop, until it actually started winning a few competitions) poster got accepted into a medical undergrad/phd conference at my/his dream college. I was so fucking over the moon, and I guess he was too because he actually is letting me travel across the country to go present my work. Though, when I got my poster (that I finalized after weeks of hard work) printed out at my local makerspace, he literally didn't even want to take a look at it. my mom just glanced at it and was like, \"cool.\" i'm literally so done. nothing I do will ever make them happy.\n\nI've been staying up till 3 am daily grinding my homework, working on my patent, preparing for research conferences/competitions, writing a research paper, and still working on getting my college apps done. I barely leave my room. Yet, every morning, he will still scream at me because of something. I'm genuinely so tired of this. I go to school practically sobbing every day,\n\nLast night, my dad was talking to my uncle about how I'm so \"unfocused\" and literally all I do is \"focus on my art\" (haven't painted in 5 months) and how the only thing i have pertinent to my major is my research and I'll not get into a good college (his version of good is HYPSM). He literally said I wasn't \"unique\" because he could name \"so many asian girls who were good at art and wanted to go into medicine.\" My uncle (both of his daughters graduated valedictorian from their IB school and attended T20s) was appalled at my father's words and kept insisting I had done more than his own daughters had ever done in high school. My father argued back.\n\nI don't know what I can do to satisfy that man. the most confusing part of all of this is that I used to be his little daddy's girl. he used to post my art all the time on his facebook or brag about me to all of his friends. I don't know what I did to change that. Anyway, there's so much I could gripe about, but it's 2:07 am and this post is already getting too long.\n\nEdit: Wow. I've been reading all the comments and am completely overwhelmed with everyone's kind words and encouragement. Thank you all so much, truly. I will do my best to get back to everyone here.\n\nI just wanted to leave a note saying I do love my family. I really do. I am grateful for my parents' hard work. I just wish they'd be grateful for mine.\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone. I've been feeling alone recently, and your comments have alleviated some of that sense of isolation. I hope everyone has a wonderful day. "

    "body": "Since starting here, the sheer amount of times that the university has made me ashamed to be here is wearing me down terribly. \n\nThey CONSTANTLY invite white supremacist speakers to the university. No students shows up, really - somehow the majority non-white student body doesn't like that (who would've guessed?). They do get a few old Tories from the area, though, so I guess that's a really big plus for my education. \n\nSome of the lecturers spend half their tutorials making us uncritically consume literal tabloid media to discuss it as if the facts are laid out accurately and fairly. \n\nIt's terribly strange, but not at all surprising when you know who's funding the university. \n\nEric Kaufmann started here recently, too, and the university administration disclosed to us students that this was due to funding from the firm Legatum. Legatum (also the funder of GB News) is a think-tank that made sudden strides a few years ago generating mass amounts of pro-brexit propaganda, and operates alongside the IEA think-tank, another close associate of the university, at 55 Tufton Street.\n\nKaufmann runs a *very* important course on \"Wokeness\", wherein he asks questions such as \"what came first? LGBT, or mental illness?\" (a verbatim title that we addressed as students and they never got back to us on whatsoever) and makes papers with graphs about how much white people are the real victims under certain policies (while typically not including any other ethnicities in the chart).\n\nHe's outlined the \"three awokenings\" (which he also calls emotional outbursts) on his substack once and the most academic thing he could come up with was a Google ngram graph of how often the word \"racism\" came up in books at the time, with three vaguely discernable surges.\n\nThese just so happen to line up with a fair few of the installments of the major civil rights acts in America and the election of Obama, for some reason, and he considers all of these ridiculous emotional outbursts from the left that were overstepping what's necessary to make a good society (he hints towards wanting these repealed a number of times).\n\nSo, he likely wants civil rights acts gone, and the university itself has made clear a number of times that they consider laws enforcing equality bad.\nThis is why it concerns me GREATLY when they don't oppose people seeking to implement laws enforcing INEQUALITY. because the \"free speech\" shit they like so much stops working when you let LITERAL white supremacists who wouldn't mind barring minorities from being able to attend institutions funded by wealthy racists.\n\nAnother example of this is the fact the Eric Kaufmann, along with the leaders of Buckingham's AFAF (Academics for Academic Freedom, allegedly) backed white supremacist Nathan Cofnas, a former Emma Cambridge employee who said loud and proud on his substack that he believes *\"In a meritocracy, Harvard faculty would be recruited from the best of the best students, which means the number of black professors would approach 0%. Blacks would disappear from almost all high-profile positions outside of sports and entertainment. This is not the kind of crisis that people will forget about after the next news cycle. The elites who have adopted wokism as their religion will launch a massive counterassault. The woke elite has far more collective intelligence than the conservative mob, and a thousand ways to outsmart and outmaneuver us.\"*\n\nKaufmann retweeted this guy's fundraiser, and the Buckingham AFAF people wrote about him being a victim of \"cancel culture\" in an article last month.\n\nSo, some of these folks seem like they might well hate black people and think they don't deserve education. So why are they allowed to teach at THIS university where the black students are are literally more numerous than the white ones? at a university where the student union is in large part run by black students because they are, in fact, representative of a huge portion of the student body? why can we just permit people to be here who think that those students are just there because of benign liberal white politics and in a REAL meritocracy they wouldn't be anywhere near?\n\nI understand the response is \"oh well free speech!!\" and mine is that they're absolutely ruining the university just to line their pockets. The incredibly diverse student body, from what I've seen, swings between indifferent and quite uncomfortable with how the university conducts themselves. A lot of students are not happy, ESPECIALLY people in the student body who actually try to achieve things. They're just here out of convenience and the only reason there's not a greater resistance to it is because nobody has the time to actually build a group of students up to doing anything because the degree time is so short.\n\nThe vice chancellor suspension is also terribly embarrassing and it's shocking how quick all of his tabloid cronies jumped to try and smear the university with their \"cancel culture\" nonsense. Even though he's suspended due to serious allegations, he keeps interacting with our university on twitter and retweeting the pro-vice chancellors stuff, seemingly without issue from her. so what's going on? is there absolutely anything serious about this university or am I just going to feel disoriented and annoyed until I'm gone? \n\nat least the degree is shorter, but fucking hell. My reputation in the future being tied to this place is already making me want to tear my hair out.\n\ndo NOT go here.\n"

    "body": "**Just some comments I think would be helpful for me:**\n\n1. **Awards don't matter nearly as much as you think.** They’re very supplementary. They will not carry an application with red flags. Most people at Ivies don't have any major awards, if any at all. In fact, just because you have solid accomplishments (e.g., a grand award at ISEF, Olympiads) doesn't mean you're guaranteed admission. I know an AIME qualifier four years in a row who didn’t even get into our state flagship. Colleges care much more about your potential than what you’ve already done. Off the top of my head, I know five ISEF award winners, two STS semifinalists, and one person who was both an STS semifinalist and an ISEF grand award winner, none of whom got into a single T20 school.\n2. **Teacher recommendations and essays matter way more than you think.** A lot of Ivies and top schools use something called a \"personality score.\" (EDIT: not necessarily a personality score, but how well you would bond in their specific community as a person). I even know someone with a 1300 SAT and basically zero extracurriculars who got waitlisted at Harvard purely because of his teacher recs and essays. For more info, he didn’t even get into our state flagship either. State schools are much more stats based so it shows that academically, this person wasn't your traditional Harvard candidate, but still was put into the pool of potential candidates.\n3. **College applications aren't quantitative.** Just because someone gets into Harvard doesn’t mean they’ll get into Cornell. Similarly, just because someone with a profile similar to yours gets into Yale doesn’t mean you will too. And crucially, just because you don’t get into UMich doesn’t mean there’s no chance you'll get into an Ivy League school. I know 2 people at my school who got deferred from UMich but ended up at a HYPSM. I was also deferred from UMich, and I ended up getting into UPenn.\n4. **Don't let people get into your head as EA and RD results roll out.** When I didn’t get into UMich, someone who did get in had the audacity to come up to me and say, “Imagine doing all that work just to end up at your state flagship.” Like, I’m not the one paying $90K a year to attend an out-of-state public school (that was them)!! Honestly, I don’t think they meant it maliciously. They were probably just insecure because they had gotten rejected from CMU CS and a few other private schools that same day, and wanted to feel superior. Sometimes, it’s best to distance yourself from people during college application season, especially the day after Ivy Day.\n5. **Don't watch college reaction videos PLEASE.** They just make the process way more heartbreaking than it needs to be. Also, don’t record your reactions. It only adds to the emotional weight, and honestly, it gets depressing.\n6. **Your unweighted GPA matters a lot.** It shows whether you can handle the school's academic rigor, and it can sometimes (though not always) reflect the strength of your teacher recs. People with higher GPAs tend to have stronger recs because they’re often more hardworking and dedicated. Of course, that's not a hard rule, and there are exceptions.\n7. **Don’t apply to schools you’re not serious about attending.** Applications are competitive enough. If you get accepted somewhere you know you won’t go, *withdraw your application*. There are too many stressed-out waitlist kids out there for you to take up a spot you don't intend to fill.\n8. **A lot of people lie about college admissions.** Maybe this is just because I go to a competitive school, but it’s real. I know someone who lied about getting into Princeton, Yale, Harvard, and Columbia because they didn’t want to be judged by underclassmen and also fellow classmates. Also, people love to downplay others' success - comments like \"they were just a diversity pick\" or \"Cornell isn’t a real Ivy\" are common (anecdotes from my sister after she committed to Cornell lol).\n9. **People will try to tear you down.** I thought it was just my school, but at UPenn admitted students day, I found out that 3 out of 4 people at my lunch table had someone try to blacklist them from colleges. One person even said someone wrote an entire essay trashing them and sent it to every school they applied to. Colleges are used to this kind of thing. It usually gets deleted or forwarded to your school administration to verify. Also, admissions officers who actually make decisions don't even see this stuff so don't worry. Your chances are not ruined.\n10. **It’s normal to get into only one school.** UPenn was the only T20 I got into. I didn’t get into UMich (a T30), Northwestern (which usually takes a good number of people from my school), or even WashU - all schools that are statistically less selective, but still amazing schools. I also know someone where Yale was the only school they got into (after getting rejected from Princeton REA, which usually has a pretty high deferral rate). It sucks, but don’t freak out. College applications are genuinely such a headache and very random.\n11. **Don’t compare your profile to others on ChanceMe or CollegeResults.** What worked for someone else won’t necessarily work for you. Colleges weigh your background heavily. Someone from a rural area doing research and scoring a 1400 SAT could absolutely get into Harvard. But at a school like TJHSST, you're expected to do much much more given your regional competition.\n\nI’m probably missing a few more points, but these are my main takeaways for now."

    "body": "Hey y'all. Just wanted to rant about my college admissions experience. Currently a graduating senior, and after all decisions have come through, in the end I will not be attending any college I wanted. I am very sad, and my family, especially my mother and father, who have worked so hard for me, is even more sad. But, I do believe it is my fault.\n\nHere are my statistics:\n\n\\-Test scores so far: 36 composite ACT - 36 reading, 35 math, 36 english, 36 science // 1530 SAT - 790 math, 740 english // 5s on 9/9 taken APs so far: bio, cs principles, cs a, chem, world history, human geo, statistics, calc ab, eng lang // 4.0 unweighted GPA\n\n\\-Extracurriculars: captain of boys varsity golf team sophomore through senior year - advanced to state competition freshman and sophomore year individually and as a team junior and senior year - placed T8th and T7th as a team junior and senior years // played a bunch of individual tournaments around the country - AJGA, FJT, etc. and placed well in some of them // member of national honor society student philanthropy council - 2 $5k grants donated to mental health community orgs. then 20 hr volunteering for NAMI // 100 volunteer hours for the First Tee organization, aiding juniors // was vice pres and treasure for school DECA club - went to states 10th, 11th, and 12th grade // cofounded both the computer science club and science national honor society chapter at my school for senior year // member of math national honor society, the spanish national honor society, and the national honor society\n\n\\-Honors: National merit finalist, AP scholar with distinction, student of the year for freshman year, honor roll all \"A\"s throughout high school\n\n\\-Class rank: 2/370\n\n\\-Went to a fairly good rated public school for four years of high school\n\n\\-Am a white middle class male\n\n  \nHeres where I faulter: I applied to UCF, FSU, UF, Vanderbilt, Duke, Dartmouth, Princeton, and Yale. No EDs, just regular decisions. I applied neuroscience academic interest for all these schools. Decisions: accepted to UCF, FSU, and UF, rejected from Duke, Dartmouth, Princeton, yale, and waitlisted from Vanderbilt.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have applied to more colleges. I should have applied to some better out of state schools, instead of just going for the \"best of the best\". I was foolish and ignorant in terms of what I thought I could get into, and did not do enough research on college admissions. I also should have ED'd, likely to Duke, had I known the acceptances for ED was easier. Additionally, I did not really know what major I was going to do in college, and therefore many of my extracurriculars do not match the neuroscience avenue I had listed. Moreover, I clicked \"I wish not to have alumni interviews\" on all my colleges. I do not know why.\n\nI also believe my essays were lackluster. My life has been fostered greatly by my parents. I have been fortunate not to have had any traumatic events yet. To note, I had no outside guidance on my essays. Therefore, I wrote my commonapp essay on golf, and my inherent struggle with keeping up to scoring expectations, which have substantially affected my golf game. My specific essays for the colleges were also all over the place. I did not have a clear sense of who I was, except that I had played golf all my life, loved family and friends, and loved science.\n\nIm going to attend UF in the summer. I should be happy for it, but im not. I feel like something is missing, like Im going down a road I wish not to go down. I dont want to feel like I'm being pretentious, but it feels like the work I have put in to get to these colleges did not mean anything at all. And I cant see past it. Additionally, I know some other people who were accepted into UF with statistics that, at least in my eyes, were less good than mine. And this sentiment has been thoroughly pointed out by many outsiders, my mother, and some of my classmates (\"How did you not get into a better school?\"). I know comparison is the thief of joy, but there is no more joy. I want to keep a positive attitude. I know its the right thing to do. But I just cant. I'm slipping, I can feel it. This is the one thing that I had geared my whole life towards, and I amounted nothing.\n\nMy mom cried tonight. I am writing this post in response to that.\n\nThanks for reading my rant.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I appreciate the responses from everyone. If it adds to anything, I am able to attend UF free of cost, of which I am extremely grateful for. I did receive a full ride scholarship to any out of state school as well, which is unfortunate I cannot use for any school. But attending UF with no cost is something I am fully appreciative of. \n\nI was in a less than ideal mental state writing this post, but I most certainly feel better after reading everyone’s responses. I look forward to UF now, even if I wasn’t accepted to the honors program first year. But I am most certainly up for the idea of transferring, or just putting in a good 4 years in a preparation for graduate school.\n\nOverall, my expectations for college admissions speak to entitlement, and it’s a lesson learned. I will work to create realistic ideals in my life, and to try to stay positive, both now and for the future. Thanks for all y’all’s input, I sincerely appreciate it."

    "body": "Super long post, sorry!!\n\nHi there. I wanted to write this post for me and those who seem like they won't be able to make it into graduate school. Let me start with some basic information of myself. I started college back in 2017, currently 26 (I know I'm unc LMAO) but I started at my local community college. Long story, short, I swapped my majors twice and graduated with an AA in Computer Information Systems. I started my Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2020. With the pandemic happening so early into my degree, my grades suffered horribly. Lack of motivation, everything seemed so bleak, and I was just in a constant state of autopilot. My GPA tanked the first semester due to me failing classes. I wasn't helping either. I would skip, not pay attention, and didn't study as hard as I should've and that's on me. Inevitably, I went on Academic Warning during my first semester at the local university I was attending. Same formula applied in 2021 and followed until the Spring 2021 semester where I was put on Academic Probation. Which means, if you drop below the cumulative minimum GPA requirement, you're kicked from the program and dismissed from the university. I started to panic because of the mistakes I made early on. And so, with that harsh reality check, my advisor placed a credits limit until I could raise my GPA. At this point, I was at a 1.03 GPA. Yeah... it was not good LOL. Despite this low, I locked in as much as a could and I grinded my undergrad. Needless to say, I was able to graduate by December 2023 at 25. I did feel behind because of my past mistakes but I was able to tank through it and jump to a 2.3 GPA. Not the best. But, passable. Now, I wish I could say everything was fine and dandy but this will come back to haunt me later. \n\n  \nAfter graduating, it took me 6 months to find a full time job. Unfortunately, even now, the job market in tech is cooked. However, I was able to find a IT job and have been working here ever since 2024. Once I was comfortable and stable, I was debating on applying to grad school. Now, I need prefix this by saying, this is a HUGE decision - for me at least. Coming from a barely passable GPA, I was embarrassed and scared thinking I'm going to flunk out and have to deal with the embarrassment of failing graduate school. I took my sweet time until I was \"you know what? F it.\" I went out of my way to apply to a more prestigious university where I live. I applied to their Master of Science in Computer Science and their Master of Science in Software Engineering for the Fall 2025 semester. Now, this is where the \"GPA comes to haunt me later\" portion comes into play. I reached out to my undergrad CS professors from my community college (from almost 5-6 years ago!) and from my recent Junior/Senior level courses! Needless to say, I applied with 5 letters of recommendation, professional tech experience as I work in the field now, and a much clearer and more mature mindset. I wish I could also say that I was accepted into one or both programs! But, to no one's surprise, I was denied. From both programs. When I tell you the feeling of defeat I had was incomprehensible, it really was! I couldn't eat, didn't want to work out, I just kind of shut down. After a while of sulking, I looked back to the university I did in my undergrad and debated if I wanted to go back. Where I'm from, there are two well-known universities. The one I was denied from and the one I was almost flunked out of. So, I went right back to those same professors and they were able to assist me in writing another couple of LoRs. Now, as of writing this post, I am currently in my Master's of Computer Science program. I'm enrolled full-time while working my full-time job. I currently have straight A's in all of my classes. I'm turning in assignments on time and working on my projects bit by bit. So, I wanted to write something for those of you who have/had a low GPA during your undergrad and want to get into grad school:\n\n  \n1.) YOU CAN GET INTO GRAD SCHOOL WITH A LOW GPA!!!! Trust me! I, along with millions of other students, can attest you're able to get into it! I'm not saying it's easy. With a low GPA like mine, it's an uphill battle because you want to prove to the Admissions Committee that you're not just ready academically but ready mentally. \n\n2.) Choose your schools with realistic expectations. Don't expect to apply and get accepted into MIT, Harvard, Yale with a low GPA. I've seen students with 4.0 GPAs and a ton of research experience get outright denied! I'm not saying it's impossible, anything is possible, but don't expect to get accepted off the bat. Trust me, I thought I was ready but reality smacked me harder than Will Smith did Chris Rock. \n\n3.) Make your application the best it can be! Focus on your Statement of Purpose! This is extremely important. Address your low GPA! Don't focus on it completely. Mention it and acknowledge that it is a weak spot but that you're not who you were x amount of months/years ago. The SOP is for you to shine and give reason as to why your committee should choose you! Talk about what you've been doing, maybe about how your job ties to your degree, how you've grown and what steps you will taking to crush your grad programs! \n\n4.) Talk with your undergraduate professors! I never spoke to mine a lot but reach out to them! Invite them to talk over coffee on campus or maybe through a Zoom/Teams chat. Like the previous point, talk to your professor about what you've been doing. Show your passion and how excited/ready you are for this opportunity. More often than not, they will willing to help with a Letter of Recommendation!\n\n5.) Letters of Recommendations are important! Make sure you reach out to as many professors as you can! You may get ignored, some professors may not being teaching anymore, and you may even get a swift denial. Don't fret. Keep sending emails to as many as you can! I was denied by a few and ignored by others. That didn't stop me because I know I wanted into the program. Don't just stop at your professors, your manager at your job can help too! Especially if your job is related to your degree! This helps a ton! \n\n6.) Apply with time! From my knowledge and experience from applying, graduate programs have limited seating. So, only a certain amount of students will be accepted into the program. Check with your grad admissions office to see when the deadline is and apply as early as you can! Not saying applying early will get you in but it will certainly help you! \n\n7.) GIVE YOURSELF GRACE! This is something I struggle with to this day but grad applications are stressful and nerve-racking but taking the first step to want to further your education is something so big, you should feel proud that you're wanting to even take said step. \n\n  \nTLDR; You're worthy of the dreams and goals you aspire to reach. Sometimes the road is bumpy but, if you fall, you get up, pivot, and execute. You CAN get into grad school with a low GPA. I'll give you one last piece of advice blow:\n\n  \nOnce you get in and, YOU WILL,:\n\n8.) BE PROUD OF YOURSELF THAT YOU GOT IN! But, getting in is the first battle, once you are in, execute! Take advantage of everything you university has to offer! Join clubs, network, attend events, career fairs, adapt better study habits, don't procrastinate! You don't want to be in the same situation you were in previously. I know I don't and, for once, my grades are reflecting that. You got this, stranger, I believe in you! "

    "score": 240,
    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1k1kbix/how_to_write_a_good_personal_statement_no_matter/",
    "body": "My advisor (a retired adcom) once told me that 5% of personal statements are irredeemably bad, 90% are fair to very good, and 5% are truly exceptional. Mine somehow landed in the “exceptional 5%” bucket, and consistently throughout the cycle, I was given feedback that my personal statement elevated the rest of my application. As no expert on the matter, I can’t tell you exactly what separates a 5% essay from the rest, but I can share my process and how you can build a strong, unique, and memorable personal statement no matter what.\n\n**CORE COMPETENCIES:**\n\nYou may be thrown off by the word “competencies”, but a shocking number of the “90%” essays do not fully satisfy these criteria. If I am an admissions officer reading your personal statement, it should answer these five questions for me (with emphasis on the first two):\n\n1. **I know what you want to be. What do you want to do?**\n2. **Why a career in medicine specifically? What about medicine allows you to accomplish what you cannot elsewhere?**\n3. What can I learn about you that the rest of your application can’t/will not tell me?\n4. Do you understand the roles and responsibilities of a physician?\n5. Are you ready to shoulder the roles and responsibilities of being a physician?\n\n**Keep these questions in mind as you write!** They will guide you towards being thoughtful and reflective, and force you to consider the true motivation behind your journey.\n\nThe answers should be a mix of explicitly stated,\n\n*”As a pediatrician, I will take on the unique intersection of mentorship, commitment, and empathy required for holistic care to ensure my patients grow, learn, and experience”*,\n\nand implied or shown,\n\n*“I lifted his legs, understanding then that care extended beyond having a syringe ready at all times; it meant \\[...\\]”*.\n\nBeyond this framework, it’s really about how you wish to flavor it. Having a special voice for literary and narrative flair is often a plus, but you can write an excellent personal statement that is also entirely concrete and to the point (this in itself could be considered a voice). Just make sure that voice is consistent. **First, worry about the content, then worry about how the content is packaged.**\n\n**FORMAT:**\n\nThere is no single convention to writing a personal statement, but there are some overarching themes that people tend to build around: a metaphor, a core belief, or a truly transformative experience. Whatever path you choose, **the emphasis should be on making sure that the narrative is** ***tight, focused, and deliberate.*** After reading thousands of other essays, an adcom is firstly going to be preoccupied with how readable your story is. Don’t make them think more than they already have to, and definitely don’t make them have to revisit earlier paragraphs to understand the ideas. If I cannot get a strong sense of who you are within the first read, you need to reformat.\n\nA tip that worked for me was to start by writing descriptively, almost conversationally, and then cut methodically. The more you read over your own work, the more you will see the parts that are irrelevant.\n\nConsider the strengths of whatever format suits you best. If you want to keep a conversational tone, emphasize your reflections and personability while making sure the light tone doesn’t bely the responsibilities of the job. If you wish to be formal, emphasize your experiences and be confident in your assertions. \n\nThe most important thing to remember is that **you do not need an incredible story to sell yourself**. This is a common misconception and one that I had before applying. I didn’t include anything in mine that would scream ‘exceptional’ from the get-go. You *do* need to be unique, but that should be communicated to me naturally if you do a thoughtful job of packaging your voice and experiences.\n\n**THE PROCESS:**\n\nThere are only two things that **must** happen while writing:\n\n1. You must spend a **long** time brainstorming, writing, and revising\n2. You must get feedback from others\n\nI’m firmly of the belief that **a majority of what you write at first will not end up in your final draft**. The *act* of writing these things and penning ideas that may or may not contribute to the final product is necessary to reach your best work. This is a longitudinal process; I remember thinking my first draft was quite solid before revisiting it fresh a week later. It was genuinely terrible, with so many problems I didn’t see at first. I had to write it to *get it out*.\n\nI ended up concretely revising my essay about 10-15 times, and maybe 7 or 8 of those revisions were spent completely scrapping entire ideas that I thought were good at first. I now have three completely different personal statements, two of which will never see the light of day; but both were necessary to reach the peak of the third.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: ***just write***. Even if you know what you’re writing will be gone in a few days, it’s so important to force yourself to think and reflect by writing. I promise, if you follow this rule, you will naturally develop a voice in your essay without trying.\n\nSecondarily, you need **feedback**. No matter how objectively you can view your own writing, you are not the one admitting yourself into medical school. Consider friends who are currently in medical school: who do they want alongside them? Consider admissions officers: who do they want representing their school? Consider doctors currently at your school: who do they want as their coworkers years down the line? These are all great options to view your work, if you can swing it. \n\nIf you don’t have any of those connections, you still need people to criticize it to make sure it stands alone as a **readable work**. It’s really easy to get lost in the storytelling aspect of your personal statement and write something that is unfocused, flowery, or self-aggrandizing, without even realizing it. Make sure you have people you can trust to give an honest opinion about the readability of your work, because that’s what matters first and foremost.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nThat’s basically all that I know regarding the personal statement.

My top four schools being NYU, Columbia, Villanova and UPenn. I also considered campus environment: i literally googled if there were party scenes at prestigious universities, if there were keeping up with the joneses cultures, and how pretty the libraries were. these were values i established right away before i looked at how their programs for my interests ranked in comparison. am i wrong in saying that this doesn’t seem common? “chance me for T20s/HYPSM.” Harvard is way different from Yale and then Princeton too? Stanford isn’t even on the same coast and MIT being the most standout? The one connecting factor between these all is just their rankings. \n\ni saved this problem for last because it makes my argument here look conceited:\n\ncollege admissions encourage people to be losers: they don’t value in any way a social life. i can’t depict the memories i’ve made at football games, dances, parties, getting crowned for royalty, or even just nights at target shopping or going to the mall. making solid connections is an accomplishment too. to be able to socialize, be personable, etc. is a skill that will get you far in life and yet college admissions processes take this into account none. now in no way am i saying this is the most important, but socialization and fraternization amongst youth is severely important, and those who can’t live socially likely will struggle in community-based environments. i understand that this is where extracurriculars should come in, but when kids are engaging in facetious extracurriculars to impress a college rather than that which attracts them most, they aren’t going to make lasting relationships because it’s not important to them there. objectively, the more facetious your extracurriculars are, the less likely you will be able to make relationships based on mutual interests, one because you don’t have mutual interests, and two because you do not care. this is no matter to the admissions process though. me personally, i find the salutation who balanced grades, sports, and a prominent social life over the valedictorian who spends his friday night writing a research paper that serves only to impress an admissions officer.\n\nnow onto who is to blame:\neveryone. likely you. definitely me at some point. especially colleges. and especially subreddits like this. the college admissions culture continues to perpetuate these narratives. even high schools cause kids to gain an over confidence because when you think you’re the best, you tend to be expecting the best. however, in every single case, there is no best university. there is no best applicant. the college application processed and all the students, parents, officers, counselors, and teachers who have encouraged you to become the “perfect applicant” by engaging in extracurriculars you don’t actually care about and throwing away your life for grades, a ranking, etc. have objectively failed you.\n\nwhat can you do to change:\ni am not trying to act like i’m perfect. three months ago i was the same kid who wanted to be that perfect applicant and only cares about going to Ivy League schools. but it took one person to snap me out of it: a random guy who i had been talking to for months but who had no similarities with me in terms of academics. this kid is attending our hometown school or CC next year for reference. but here’s what he asked me that snapped me out of the haze of prestige: “tell me more about the schools you’re applying to” and when I couldn’t tell\nhim about UChicago, Yale, MIT, JHU, etc., beyond excusing them for their rigor and taking, he asked me “why the fuck would [I] apply there?” however there were a few schools i could tell him about being the four top schools prior. this kid who barely cares about school lectured me and pointed out the connections that i once cared about and then had forgotten about following my illusion by threads like this. it was then that i realized i would not be applying early to a school I do not care about, nor would i be applying at all. so my advice to anybody reading this to snap the fuck out of it and find a school that works for you. for me, it’s NYU. I dream of New York City. I see artists hosting surprise concerts and doing events there and I dream of it. I saw kids riding the subway, kids just like me, leading that urban lifestyle, and dreamt of it. so fuck the prestige. find the university that you dream of. and the rest of it will come to you. and go to the basketball games, attend a school dance, participate in a spirit week. because you’ll never get to do it again.\n\nEDIT: every single time you try to compare stats or demean my application or act as though you’re better than me, you are doing nothing to actually improve your argument you are just proving my point. i am satisfied with what i’ve done and quite frankly just because i’m criticizing college admissions doesn’t mean i’m a weak applicant as which some of you have chosen to assume. stop comparing or demeaning other’s applications because it’s only showing your insecurities. be confident in yourself and in your argument if you have an argument against me rather than trying to attack my character."

I (31 NB/AMAB) was laid off from my job (as part of a mass layoff) at an F500 a few months back (July) and have been doing some soul searching in the time since.  \n\nSo this has been my path so far:\n- AA from HCC (finished)\n- BA from UH (finished)\n- MS from Liberty University (dropped out for moral reasons)\n- 5 years at F500 company as an IT analyst\n- MS from BU (in progress, expected December 2025)\n- MA from ASU (incoming January 2026)\n\nI started to remember how much I enjoyed political science, specifically, a field that I now know is called political psychology.  What I found the most interesting about this field is the exploration of why people think, vote and believe the ways that they do (as a Texan, this especially applies to my neighbors). I also realized that a major reason for why I chose to go for a Master's in Data Science at BU was implicitly because one of my poli sci professors at UH mentioned the importance of a good quant foundation as a political scientist.\n\nI realized how years of attempting to please my parents led me to, first, go to Liberty University (a school I never wanted to go to) and work a corporate job.  I might still have a house and I might have gotten experience, but it cost me my mental and physical health, as well as a deep sense of regret that my parents losing their home (during the year that I graduated) led me to this state of survival to the point that I lost all sense of my own humanity.\n\nSo, yeah, even with the job market being what it is, my personal circumstances, et al. I applied to three programs - all online because, as being me in Texas, I wanted to make sure that I could flee anywhere if necessary, even though this is my home state.\n\nThen this happened:\n\nFriday (September 12) - I changed course on my capstone project for the MSDS and started modeling on hate speech datasets.\n\nSaturday (September 13) - I got my first admit to IU Online and spent the day imagining myself as an IU alumni with an MA in Political Science.\n\nMonday (September 15) - I got my second admit to ASU, which was my target, and stalked LinkedIn profiles of IU and ASU grads, and found that the ASU grads seemed to be doing pretty well for themselves. Then, I proceeded to imagine myself as an MA in Political Psychology graduate and liked that vision, especially since this is what I want to specialize in, if nothing else.\n\nI also saw that ASU Online has plenty of resources for online students, way more than what BU has been able to give us and what IU Online could provide.\n\nSo why am I writing this post?  I'm not even a doctoral student and I'm choosing to do two masters instead of going a step above, after all.\n\nA bunch of you clearly have self doubt and, to be honest, look for validation about whether or not you're going on the right path, choosing the right degree, obsessed with rankings, etc. and afraid to even try before taking a leap.  Trust me, I know, because that's literally me on most days.\n\nBut you also know yourself best, so trust yourself when your mind and heart are aligned and saying the same thing, to just apply to that program or pursue that field EVEN if it seems impractical.\n\nDon't just accept your regrets if you're older.  And, if you're younger, don't think that you need to plan your entire life for the next 20 years, you could literally be using that time studying or working on applications.  Through what I've gone through over the past few years, I've come to realize my own path, even in spite of chronic mental and physical health issues.  \n\nAnd, academically, what I've gone through is beautiful, even if mundane.  HCC taught me self discipline, UH taught me how to learn, BU taught me to be resilient, and ASU will allow me to live my dream.  What you've gone through is also beautiful and your story to tell adcoms.\n\nThere's no perfect way for any of us to live this life.  All we know is that we want to be happy and live without regrets wherever we can help it."

    "body": "I felt the need to make this post based on my experience last year when I started the process of planning my further education. \n\nBack in January, my tutor started talking to us about our future plans for what we would like to do after college. \n\nAs part of their training, teachers are told to ensure that all students apply to at least one university in the top third majority (not consider applying, go through the whole process). It is believed that the students who get in can earn higher income and get a better job based on their choice. \n\nMy teacher was really strict on us with this, giving us 15 minute lectures about how important it is to choose the right university, and giving us a list of ‘approved’ places to look into. \n\nThat night, I went home to talk with my parents about what my teacher had said. We had already booked 2 open days for universities in the bottom third majority, the universities that my teacher specifically told us to ‘avoid’, but we also booked one with a university in the top third, to keep an open mind and follow the instructions that we were given. \n\nIt is important to mention at this point that I have additional needs, and have been disadvantaged by the exam system. I am currently waiting for accommodations to resit my 2 written exam units from last year. \n\nOn all 3 open days, I spoke to each professor in person, explaining that I had the knowledge and ability to complete the course, but I was still waiting to receive the help needed to complete the exam units. \n\nThe first 2 universities, both in the bottom majority, explained that written exams were unimportant to them, and as long as I completed the coursework to the best of my ability, I would have no trouble at all in receiving a place on their courses. These 2 are now my top and insurance choices for further education. \n\nThe university in the top majority, however, told us that written exams were seen as the highest priority, and although they didn't say it to my face, it was obvious that I would be rejected if I applied, because of my lower grades in those two specific units.\n\nI returned from that open day very upset, feeling like I just didn't belong in the top majority universities, but at the same time like I didn't really have any other option. My additional needs means that I can't stay away from home full time, as I need extra help with household duties such as laundry, changing the bed sheets, etc. I would therefore have to come home on weekends. \n  \nMy parents had a long talk with me after that third open day, and I would like to share their words with you. \n\nThere are occasional times where it is completely ok to ignore the rules and instructions that the teachers have given you. In my case, choosing unis is a great example. Just because someone has said that you should apply for a top majority university, it absolutely doesn't mean that you have to. \n\nUniversity is your choice, not your teacher’s. In my case, a university lower in rankings works better for me, and I am happy with my choice. But you never know, someone might excel the most in exams and decide that they want to go to a high-ranked university. That is their choice. Obviously, keep an open mind, look at lots of different options, even if you don’t know if you are interested. But please, for the love of god, don’t choose to apply somewhere just because someone else has told you to do so. "

I am interested in majoring in business management, economics, finance, or something similar within that field. I would absolutely love to go to a great school like the ones mentioned above, but I can accept staying home to attend one of my safety schools full-ride if necessary (either due to my health problems persisting into next year or due to being rejected from my reach schools).\n\nI am a student from a public high school who has faced a tremendously difficult health problem the last 2 years of my life. It has left me bedridden for half of my sophomore year and the entirety of my junior year, although I am thankfully able to be just healthy enough to attend in-person school for my senior year. I am an academically inclined student with a 36 ACT composite score (36E 36M 36R 36S), a 4.73 Weighted GPA out of 4, and I will most likely be selected as valedictorian of my graduating class of \\~1100 students. I will have taken 14 APs by the end of my senior year, 3 of which have been completely self-studied. (Sadly, I was too sick to take any of the AP tests the last two years, so I won't have any of those AP scores until the end of my senior year.)\n\nHowever, due to my extenuating circumstances, I was only able to do anything for around 2-4 hours a day, so all of that time went towards completing my coursework for online school. As such, I have no school or sport-affiliated extracurriculars. While I was sick, I conducted extensive medical research in collaboration with several medical experts, in an attempt to determine what was causing my severe health problems, so that could potentially work as some sort of extracurricular. I did also wrestle at the beginning of my Sophomore year, right before I fell ill, but nothing other than that during sophomore and junior years. However, since I am well enough to attend school this year, I have joined several clubs, such as my school's math competition prep club (for competing in events such as AMC), DECA, my school's Speech and Debate team, and a few other clubs here and there.\n\nI have been told that most of the best schools value unique or interesting personal stories, but I have also heard that they place a heavy emphasis on extracurriculars as well. I am not sure which is the most true, or if it is a mixture of both. For my personal essays, I talked about the lessons learned from my illness, and how it has improved and strengthened my character. (That was one of the Common App personal essay prompts.) I feel like I have a pretty unique personal story, but I don't know if it is enough to make up for the gap in my application where extracurriculars should be.\n\nSince I present such a strange case, I face quite the dilemma in regards to my college application process. My health problems have severely reduced my ability to participate in extracurriculars, and unfortunately significantly inhibits my cognitive capabilities, so it is harder for me to complete coursework and perform well on standardized testing. (If I hadn't fallen ill, I would have done much more, both in regards to academics and extracurriculars.) Do you think college admissions offices would find these circumstances as a fair justification to my lack of extracurriculars? I have heard mixed responses from my counselors and family friends who have worked with college admission officers, so I really don't know what to expect going into the application process for such prestigious institutions. Any advice or input is greatly appreciated, and I am willing to provide any more information, if needed. Thank you so much for taking the time to help me!\n\n(Sorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to make sure I presented all relevant information)\n\nIf you can, please interact with this post, so more people can see it. I would love to get as many perspectives and opinions as possible here!\n\n"

I was rejected from nearly every other school I applied to. I can recall how stressful applications were and I sympathize with anybody who's having a difficult time right now.\n\nAnyway, after spending a bit of time on this sub, here's some things I learned from my experiences that I don't see discussed that much.\n\nRegrets:\n\n1. **Not looking into minors that much.** I was so focused on finding a school with a good program that I wanted for my major that I ended up at one that doesn't have the minor that I want. I'm happy with the minor I'm doing instead but the one I initially wanted and would switch to if they ever offer it a fairly common minor at nearly every other school, my school is just weird.\n2. **Becoming really superstitious.** I started seeing rejections as signs that things wouldn't work out and my life would go to pieces. I wish I had cut that line of thinking down way ahead because a couple years of OCD-type symptoms and various mental health diagnoses later and it's hard to deal with. College applications didn't give me these symptoms, I was predisposed because of my nature, but they were a factor in how it escalated.\n3. **Over-editing my application.** My tip is that, if you're at the point where you're changing the same phrase over and over again, just pick one and be done. I spent so many hours changing things when it was the very first, fairly unedited application I submitted that coincidentally had the best results.\n\n4, the biggest one. **Writing a trauma essay.** My common application essay was primarily about a thing that traumatized me (like diagnosed PTSD, although I didn't disclose diagnoses) and how I dealt with it. I was actively encouraged by my school and family members to pursue this topic. On one hand, the initial process of writing it was cathartic. However, getting edits from other people ended up way too personal for my comfort and, now that I'm in college, sometimes people like to talk about or share their essays: it's such a minor thing but I honestly regret that I hate looking at my essay now. It makes me uncomfortable and it isn't like I've had massive social consequences for saying \"Oh I don't think I saved my essay and I don't really remember what it was on,\" but I wish I had an essay I was proud of and not one I keep hidden away in a folder because it embarrasses me to read it.\n\nYou know yourself better, write the trauma essay if you want. I'd be a hypocrite to say it didn't get the results I ultimately wanted. But, if I could go back in time, I'd write a different essay and include the trauma as context somewhere else."

Is it a problem if I forgot to send C in?\n- Does my dream school require official test scores?\n- Does School A offer a thus-and-such major?\n- How much financial aid can I expect from OOS State U if I’m out-of-state (or international)?\n- Will the school remind me of what I need to do?\n- Will the school tell me if something is missing?\n\nOf course the answer to all of these things is… \n\n*It is incumbent upon* **YOU** *to take on the responsibility to proactively identify and diligently adhere to each school’s specific requirements for what they need, what is optional, when they want things, how they want them etc.  These specific requirements will have been clearly outlined on each school’s admissions website.*\n\nThere is absolutely no reason whatsoever to ask these questions of total strangers on the internet. \n\nIf you are a senior in high school, from this day forward — from submission of your applications straight through the day of your college graduation — you will need to be in the mode of being a proactive, diligent, fully-autonomous being.  AKA - you will need to be an adult.\n\nThis is important, because this is not just about the application and admissions process.  This will extend to every facet of your life in college.\n\nColleges and professors (especially professors) will not “ask you” for things. They will not chase you down for things.  They will not follow up with you to remind you about things.  There will be many things that they won’t ever actually mention to you directly. And if you ask five friends on campus what is due or when, you’ll get six answers, any of which may well be incorrect.\n\nWhat schools and professors **WILL** do is expect you to KNOW these things.  They will expect this because they will clearly enumerate all of these things — requirements/wants/needs/demands, etc — somewhere. Somewhere that you have ready access to: a school website, a form, a syllabus, a handbook, a resource guide, a registrar’s catalog, an online course platform, etc.  You will be told that these things exist and where to find them  After that, the onus is completely on YOU to become familiar with these resources and all the content they contain and for you to provide all necessary things to the required party in the required manner, form, and time.\n\nWhat does this mean in practical terms?\n\nSome bright morning in late August of next year you will be told by a professor “*The full syllabus is available on Canvas… please review it*” and that professor will proceed to never again mention the syllabus, or anything on it. Ever.\n- If you do not read every word on that syllabus and note every quiz, exam, review session, paper, grading rubric, due date etc… you do so at your own peril.  \n- Even though that professor might never once utter the name “Geoffrey Chaucer” at any point in time during August, September, October, or November, it’s entirely possible that you’ll walk into class the day before Thanksgiving break and be stunned to find that the professor is collecting the term paper on the importance of the Canterbury Tales in establishing modern English literature as we know it… which is due that very day\n- You will be further stunned to learn that this term paper accounts for 25% of your final grade and if not turned in by the end of class that day (as noted on the syllabus) will be recorded as a ZERO\n- There will have never been reminders about that paper, unlike in high school \n- There will never have been interim due dates for an outline, or a first draft, or a second draft, or peer review sessions, unlike in high school\n- There will never have been emails home to your parents or a “parent resources” website where they can check to see what is due when, so your parents can make sure you’re keeping up with your work, unlike in high school\n- Unlike in high school, there will certainly be no meeting between you and your parents and your advisor and that teacher for your parents to beg for the opportunity for you to “make it up” at a later date or via some “extra credit assignment” nor will anyone want to hear why that’s important because you want to apply to a top Law/Med/Grad school some day\n- There will simply be a ZERO listed next to that assignment on Canvas… and the stark reality that the best grade you can ever possibly get in that class is now going to be a C — and a low C, at that according to the syllabus — assuming that you get a 100% on everything else… including attendance.  And while the professor never explicitly stated out loud that attendance counts toward 10% of your final grade, nor did they ever say anything to you about you missing class most Fridays, they will happily point out that this fact was also listed on the syllabus\n- And you will realize that cold day in November that your hopes of having a perfect 4.0 when you eventually apply to that top Law/Med/Grad school in a few years were torpedoed — by you and you alone — on that bright, sunny morning of your very first week on campus, when you didn’t review the syllabus.\n\nAnd this will not just be academic stuff.\n- You won’t know you forgot to pay your utility bill three days ago until you return to your apartment after class and find there’s no electricity… on a Friday at 5pm when it’s 95 degrees (or 55 degrees) in your apartment and the office doesn’t reopen until Tuesday (it’s a 3-day weekend).  There will, however, have been a clear paragraph in your lease explaining that is exactly what would happen if you didn’t pay your utility bill within three days of the due date.\n- You’re gonna be hungry towards the end each week the rest of the semester, because you won’t have been told on September 15th that “today” is the last day to change your meal plan. But you will have been told in May to read the full terms of the dining plan agreement that you blithely signed in June without a thought\n- Your car will be towed when you park somewhere that you think you should be able to park on a Saturday, even though that booklet you were given when you bought your student parking pass specifically says you can’t park there on any Saturday when there is a home football game\n- You will miss out on that class that you really need to take next semester in order to graduate on time because, when you went to sign up for it, you found out that there was a registration hold on your account. Seems you never submitted all your immunization records at the beginning of the semester, as outlined on the student health portal.\n- Speaking of the student health portal, one day in September your parents are going to call you, irate, asking why your account has been charged $3,500 for mandatory student health insurance.  $3,500 worth of insurance coverage that you don’t need because you’re already covered by your parents’ health insurance.  If only you had read that bold flashing banner that’s been on top of the portal since the first day of the semester telling you that the deadline to upload a picture of your insurance card in order to waive the $3,500 insurance charge was last week.\n\nSounds kind of dire? Maybe.\n\nIs it the reality? Absolutely. Each of the things described above happened to people I know.\n\nTL/DR: From this day forward — from submission of your applications straight through the day of your college graduation — you will need to be in the mode of being a proactive, diligent, fully-autonomous being.  AKA - an adult."

    "body": "\nEDIT: I ended up getting into the two best universities in my state and getting a really nice full time job so all of u were wrong 😘\n\n\n\nI started college at 16 through my state’s Running Start program and did okay, mostly Bs and Cs. Then COVID hit, and I didn’t get into any universities, so I stayed at community college. During that time, I got really depressed and ended up with four quarters of straight 0.0s. I took a two-year break and only returned this past spring.\n\nMy GPA at my old CC was a 2.26, and at my current one it’s a 3.0. My cumulative GPA is now a 2.45. I just finished my associate’s degrees and applied to several schools, including one with an 80% transfer acceptance rate and still didn’t get in. I’ve been told my essay and extracurriculars are strong, but I didn’t get into any schools I applied to.\n\nI can’t stay at community college another year. I feel completely stuck and don’t know what to do. If anyone has advice or has been through something similar, please help.\n\nI’m begging 🙏 \n\nAfter reading the comments: I realized I just ruined my life and there isn’t a way for me to fix it anymore. I can’t afford an out of state school and I can’t go back and change the past. I already took a break and refocused and I did see major improvement towards the end but I think it’s time for me to just give up on everything. There is no point of continuing anything anymore. "

    "body": "Hi loves!\n\nThis sub recently popped up on my home page and reminded me of the demon that is the college application cycle so I wanted to tell you all (specifically the folks who feel like everything hinges on their college acceptance) what I wish someone had told me in high school.\n\nPrioritize your own HAPPINESS, college is NOT nearly as important as you think.\n\nLook, before you ignore this post as another placating message meant to make those who didn't get into their dream school(s) feel better, please hear me out.\n\nI know what it's like to be in your position. I spent hours in high school pouring over posts in this sub, cried many times about stress and the pressure to succeed, and even prayed to God promising to be a better person if I get into my dream school (help im Buddhist wtf was I even thinking 😭).\n\nI spent countless hours planning and executing my extracurriculars in a way I hoped college admissions officers would like the most, pushed myself to keep an unweighted 4.0 throughout high school, and tailored all my essays towards nameless faceless admissions officers I will never meet.\n\nThroughout this whole process, from freshman year to Ivy day, I told myself that \"its ok if I am miserable right now, if I don't love what I am doing, if I don't spend enough time with my friends and family, if I allow this constant stress and pressure to turn me into someone I am not - because once I get into college everything will be ok.\"\n\nSo my REA school deferred me in December I was incredibly bummed out. I felt like it was a criticism of my person rather than an indication of what the school wanted for their specific class for that specific year. I decided to forgo relaxing and having fun for the remainder of my senior year in favor of letting my anxiety around college results get the best of me. I came to the realization I might have depression around this time, but told myself everything would be better after I got into college.\n\nCome March I open my portal on Ivy day to find out I have gotten into the school I dreamed of since I was in middle school! I would be lying if I said it wasn't probably the happiest day of my life. I felt like I had finally made my parents proud and achieved something as a result of my work. I knew from then on I could relax, do the things I wanted to do, be the person I wanted to be, and most importantly BE HAPPY!\n\nWRONG!!\n\nThe past year has been the absolute worst year of my existence (no hyperbole intended). I struggled a lot with going from being the smartest in my class to struggling in all my classes (pure math majors please think twice about your decision 💀). All the clubs that I had wrote about in my application turned out to have 5% acceptance rates and three rounds of applications. I was overwhelmed with the sheer number of people I was surrounded by after coming from a small high school, and it wasn't until this March I would say I found \"my people.\"\n\nAnd all that self-growth and self-discovery I told myself would happen in college never materialized. I spent a lot of the winter shut in my dorm and depressed about how my experience was going.\n\nSome of my high school friends went on to \"less prestigious\" schools than mine, and honestly I would trade with them to experience college the way they are over how I am. After my first year some of them have internships and summer jobs lined up and I don't, because in the end its about YOU, your drive and passion and work, not just the college you go to.\n\nI came to realize the college I go to is probably not the best fit for me. I would have most likely better adjusted to a smaller liberal arts school over where I am today, and wished I had picked that option instead. Because the rat race never truly ends, once you are done competing with your peers for college then it will be for internships and after that jobs and then promotions and it quite literally never ends. So please prioritize yourself! Take some time to think about what is really important to you and make sure you spend some time every day doing that. Enjoy the little moments in life!\n\nA \"prestigious\" school WILL NOT make you happy. If you are unhappy now please please talk to a therapist or a psychologist or a friend or a parent or anybody. If you are insecure or lonely or anxious this is something to work on NOW. A college acceptance will NOT change who you are, only your environment, so please put in the work for yourself today.\n\nIf anyone has any questions or wants to chat please pm me, would love to help :)"

    "body": "Exactly what it sounds like; my college decisions ranked 19-1 by how much I cared about receiving them. Quick stats: I am a girl from Los Angeles, CA with a 3.6 UW and 4.2 W GPA, 33 ACT, and 5 major extracurriculars with 3 leadership roles. I am paying for college myself, but it’s a complicated situation financially. AMA!!! \n\nThe List\n\n19) California State University, Chico: Accepted \n\nI got into this school this morning despite never applying. Apparently, the Cal State redirected me here (spoilers, sorry) even though I never filled out a school preference for redirection. The more acceptances the merrier, I suppose. \n\n18) University of California, Merced: Accepted\n\nHonestly, I only applied here because it was free and the UC sent me an email asking me to apply. \n\n17) University of California, Riverside: Accepted\n\nSee Merced. \n\n16) University of Utah: Accepted with Scholarship\n\nThe first college I submitted my application to! Seemed like a really good backup school in the interest of saving money, as in addition to WUE, I also received a merit scholarship, giving me a total $17k discount. However, I said no because although I really love the Utahan mountain landscape, I'm really not a fan of the politics. \n\n15) Smith College: Waitlisted -> Rejected\n\nApplied because it was free and seemed cool. I realized that a women's college wasn’t for me pretty soon after I submitted it. I got waitlisted and did not care by that point so I didn't write a LOCI and got rejected off the waitlist.\n\n14) Northeastern University: Waitlisted -> Accepted (NY Scholars) with Scholarship\n\nAlso applied here for free. I was surprised to get waitlisted because the acceptance rate was in the single digits, and I was even more surprised to get into their New York Scholars program with a $7k scholarship off the waitlist because 1) my best friend who is WAY smarter than me (she's going to Northwestern) got straight up rejected  and 2) I didn't realize one could get a merit scholarship off the waitlist. Still too expensive though. \n\n13) Fordham University (Rose Hill): Accepted with Scholarship \n\nApplied here for free as well, but got in with $33k in merit! Was super into this school for like 5 minutes because I really wanted to live in New York, but then realized that being that far from where I and my family live in LA was lowkey scary… Also, even with the money, Fordham was still borderline more expensive than my favorite school I got into.\n\n12) University of Oregon: Accepted with Scholarship \n\nFirst school I got into! I really loved this campus and Eugene, and I liked how affordable it was (I got $13k in merit). However, I didn't like how far it was from a major city, a factor I found somewhat important, especially at a school further from home.\n\n11) Loyola University Chicago: Accepted with Scholarship\n\nLowkey fell in love with Loyola, especially since I got $31k in merit which made it the fifth cheapest school I got into. In addition to that, I had a hard time saying no to being in the same city as my best friend, but LUC’s lack of name recognition and school culture compared to other schools I was accepted to unfortunately made me decide not to attend.\n\n10) University of Miami: Deferred -> Waitlisted -> Rejected\n\nI actually really liked the idea of going here because I LOVE Miami as a city and I really liked the idea of going to like a big \"school spirit\" footbally school, but MY GOD is Miami expensive. Because of the cost, I didn't super care after I got deferred and then waitlisted (make up your mind, Miami).\n\n9) New York University: Rejected \n\nSimilar to Miami. I LOVE LOVE LOVE New York, but it was so insanely expensive that I didn't really mind getting rejected.\n\n8) University of California, Santa Cruz: Accepted\n\nThe first on this list that I truly considered going to! I really loved the campus (and the price tag, being in state), but I just couldn't wrap my head around the relative isolation that Santa Cruz has from major cities without a car, and the housing crisis and relative lack of traditional, social “school spirit” scared me off a bit. Sorry, banana slugs.\n\n7) California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo: Rejected\n\nHonestly, this was my only rejection that I was truly surprised by. I would have liked to go to SLO because I really liked its very low price, beach culture, and 3-hour train distance from my house, but I wasn't devasted about the rejection because I was (again) a little off-put about the distance from a city.\n\n6) George Washington University: Accepted with Scholarship\n\n I really really liked GWU, and as someone who wants to go into politics as a profession, this school seemed like a great idea in terms of location. However, even with $17k in merit, the school was just over my hard cutoff price of $70k a year. Plus, DC was a little further from home than was ideal. I'm okay with my decision, but I feel a little sad at what might have been every time I watch the West Wing. DC, I'll come back for you someday (maybe for law school).\n\n5) University of Colorado, Boulder: Accepted \n\nThis was by FAR my HARDEST school to turn down. I literally agonized over my decision until like April 28th (talk about a buzzer-beater). I loved, like, EVERYTHING about Boulder. I loved the Flatirons. I loved the hiking culture. I loved the major party scene and Greek life. I loved the STUNNING campus and college town. But there was one school I loved more…\n\n4) San Diego State University: Waitlisted -> Rejected\n\nThis decision was unexpectedly disappointing; I was one of very few of my friends who didn’t get in, and I really would have liked to go here. I liked the city vibe and distance from home, to say nothing of the beach and the SUPER LOW price. But like… whatever…\n\n3) The school I chose! See end of list. \n\n2) University of California, San Diego: Waitlisted -> Rejected\n\nI liked UCSD just as much as the school I chose, but if I had gotten accepted here, I probably would have gone because it was bit cheaper and closer to home, while still being far enough away that it was different. Plus, well, the beach.\n\n1) University of California, Berkeley: Rejected \n\nEven though I knew I wasn't getting in, this was still lowkey devasting. I really would have loved Berkeley, I loved its prestige, school spirit, low price, and closeness to San Francisco, my favorite city. Oh well.\n\nFinally, \nWhat I picked: UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, SEATTLE! \n\nWhile choosing between UW and Boulder was really hard, UW was the right choice for me in the end. I loved that it was in a big city with many opportunities, I loved the major school spirit I saw all around campus, I loved its relative prestige, and I loved the beauty of the campus and Seattle itself. I'm so excited to go here this fall, GO DAWGS!"

People put so much stock into the prestige of a school when that's not super important for every person, and for a lot of students with more average stats, is completely irrelevant. \n\nTo speak on personal experience, my top school for quite a while now has been Bryn Mawr College. It had a lot of what I wanted and I liked its prestige. That said, to get in, I would have had to boost my SAT score a lot and even then, it would be a matter of just hoping for the best. After a few visits and a bit more research, however, I decided it wasn't the best choice for me.\n\nNow, I plan on attending one of my safeties (Washington College in MD) to major in Education and American studies. It doesn't have the same prestige as Bryn Mawr, but it will allow me to graduate debt free and live the life I want to live.\n\nMy point in all of this being, if you're not a top student, you'll still be ok. There are so many colleges out there and just because some are prestigious doesn't mean they're a good fit for you. Choose what is best for you, not what people with 1550+ SAT scores believe is best for everyone. \n\nYou got this! 😊🫂\n\nEdit: typo"

    "body": "Despite the title, I'm genuinely so serious about this, although it is somewhat true LOL. As you all know, the college commitment deadline, May 1st, is in less than a week, but I still haven’t committed to a college yet. I'm having a really tough time deciding where to commit and would love any advice.\n\nI’m currently considering these four colleges:\n\n1. **RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology)** \n\n**Major**: Computer Engineering\n\n2. **Purdue University**; Purdue Polytechnic Institute at Purdue University in West Lafayette \n\n**Major**: Computer Engineering\n\n3. **NYU**; Tandon School of Engineering\n\n**Major**: Electrical & Computer Engineering\n\n4. **NEU (Northeastern University)**; Khoury College of Computer Science, Oakland first year → Boston\n\n**Major**: Computer Science\n\nHere are some of the important factors I’m considering and concerns I have about these schools:\n\n**MAJOR:**\n\nWhen I applied to college, I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to major in computer SCIENCE or computer ENGINEERING, and honestly, I’m still not very sure. I don’t know which one is more suitable for me. I took APCSA this year, and honestly, I did not like it. BUT, I can definitely recount times where I’ve really enjoyed coding, so I’m not sure if this class was an exception/anomaly. OVERALL, I’M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT WHAT MAJOR I WANT TO DO, BUT I DEFINITELY KNOW IT’S WITHIN THE STEM FIELD. \n\nJust in case, I’d also like to know how easy it is to switch majors at these schools (both within and between schools).\n\n**RANKING:**\n\n**NYU**: I’ve heard some mixed opinions on Tandon’s reputation. While NYU seems way more selective, the ranking for Tandon is #27 for CS and #42 for engineering on US News. If I wanted to switch to CS within Tandon, how hard would that be? \n\n**NEU**: For NEU, I heard that they’re changing their entire curriculum soon, and it feels a little risky since I don’t know how that’ll turn out. I’ve also heard a lot of criticism on NEU’s acceptance rate/ranking inflation, and the fact that they still haven’t sent me my financial aid package is not helping 💀. \n\n**Purdue**: Though I have a few concerns about the school (read in “Social Life/Campus Life”), Purdue is ranked very highly for engineering, so I’m wondering if the strength of the program compensates for those concerns.\n\n**RIT**: It’s the cheapest option, and it’s ranked #6 for co-op programs, but I’m not sure if I can see myself staying there for all 4 years. If I go to RIT, I’d probably want to transfer out after the first year. Does anyone know how hard it is to transfer from RIT into a better-ranked school as a CS/CE major, and whether I should just try to transfer no matter where I go for my first year?\n\n**FINANCIAL AID**:\n\nIn terms of financial aid, the cost goes:\n\n1. **RIT**, 21k\n2. **Purdue**, 50k\n3. **NYU**, 70k\n4. **NEU**; haven’t received my financial aid package yet\n\nAlthough cost IS a factor that I’m considering while making this decision, if the opportunities, experiences, and education is better at a school that is more expensive, I’m willing to invest in that. Additionally, I’ve heard of people who have gotten co-ops or internships that lower the cost of their tuition, and sometimes even cover it entirely. I want to know if this is realistic for me at my more expensive schools. \n\n**LOCATION**:\n\nI live in NY, and while my parents want me to stay close, it isn’t super high on my priority list.\n\n* **NYU**: less than an hour drive\n* **NEU**: 3-hour drive\n* **RIT**: 6-hour drive\n* **Purdue**: All the way in Indiana (so via plane)\n\n**SOCIAL LIFE/CAMPUS LIFE:**\n\nI haven’t visited any of these schools, so I’m not very familiar with the campus and social life (please give thoughts on this, especially if you’re a current student!!)\n\n* **NYU**: I got into NYU as a spring semester admit. I’m worried that this will affect my ability to make friends, find roommates, and get involved. Does anyone know how spring admits usually handle housing and social life? Can I dorm with people who started in the fall? Also, what do spring admits even do during the fall semester?\n* **NEU**: I’d be starting at the Oakland campus for my first year, and then transferring to Boston. I feel like I’d be missing out socially by not being in Boston my first year. How’s the transition process and how is Oakland?\n* **Purdue**: It’s a very rural place, so I’m worried that it might feel isolating or overwhelming to me, considering I’ve spent my entire life in NYC.\n\n**SUMMARY**:\n\n* Overall, how do these schools compare for Computer Science/Engineering (and electrical for NYU)?\n* How easy is it to switch majors at each school?\n* Which school best prepares you for your future and offers the most opportunities or co-op/internships?\n* What are the social scenes like, especially for spring admits at NYU and Oakland campus students at NEU?\n* How much should I care about the rankings/reputation?\n* Are these tuitions worth it?\n* How easy is it to transfer out of any of these schools if I don’t feel like it’s the best fit?\n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTE:**\n\n* I did get a **guaranteed admission for fall 2026 to BU** (College of Engineering for CE); is this worth transferring into? \n\nThank you so much to anyone who took the time to read all this 😢 I really appreciate any advice or personal experiences you have!\n\n**UPDATE INQUIRY:**\n\nTHANK YOU FOR ALL THE RESPONSES AND ADVICE. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT! After reading all the suggestions, Purdue is definitely coming on top. However, I did see a few comments talking about Purdue Polytechnic vs Purdue College of Engineering. From what I understand, Purdue College of Engineering offers a more traditional and rigorous engineering program, and Purdue Polytechnic seems to have a more applied, hands-on approach, but overall, less prestigious than the College of Engineering. That said, I’m wondering if Purdue Polytechnic is still the strongest choice? Is it hard to transfer to the College of Engineering?\n\nAlso a lot of people are saying RIT is great for co-ops, what about NEU? It's ranked higher in terms of co-op, is it the same or better?"

    "body": "Hi everyone! This summer has been going by quickly, and we’re only two to three months from Ph.D. applications opening back up. When I applied last year, it was around this time that I buckled in and started to take the process seriously. Looking back, I highly recommend starting your writing process in August—the more time you give yourself, the happier you’ll be with your final application!\n\nI was fortunate to have a successful cycle as a first-time applicant to biological/biomedical sciences Ph.D. programs in the US, despite the insanity that plagued the admissions process. I applied to \\~11 programs, received interview invites from 10 (I turned down 2 because I was overwhelmed), got 7 offers, and was waitlisted post-interview from the last one. Just to briefly share my “stats” ***(which I don’t think matter nearly as much as the written statements and LORs)***: I majored in Molecular Biology with minors in Chemistry and Math from a T100 R1 school with a 3.7 GPA. I took 2 gap years for an NIH post-bacc, so I had a little over 2 years of full-time research experience when I applied. No publications, just two posters.\n\nOkay! On to the advice!\n\nBefore you begin writing, there are three questions you need to be able to answer because they will come up in some way, shape, or form at least fifty times this cycle:\n\n* **Why do you want to get a Ph.D. in \\[insert field here\\]?** \n   * You have to be able to convince the admissions committee that you **need** a Ph.D. to achieve your career goal. If they believe, even for a second, that you could maybe accomplish this with a master’s or just more work experience, they’ll give the spot to a person who demonstrates the need for a doctorate\n   * *For example, professors and senior R&D scientists in industry or government (and other scientific leadership positions) are generally understood to “require” a Ph.D., while there’s a little more ambiguity about whether consultants and clinical researchers must have a Ph.D.*\n* **What do you want to study in graduate school?**\n   * **Keep it broad.** The narrower your research interests are, the harder it is to convince a program to let you in (this is a part of fit, which we’ll get into later). If your research interests are super narrow and only one P.I. is working in that area, they probably won’t let you in. Why? Well, what happens if that P.I. isn’t accepting students, or you don’t get along with them? Will you even consider working with someone else? Would you even stay in the program?\n   * **These are all very valid concerns for an admissions committee trying to figure out who should be in their rotation cohort**\n   * If you’re interested in a specific pathway implicated in cancer, instead of saying “I want to study XYZ pathway”, you can say “**I hope to study protein-protein (or protein-nucleic acid) interactions that are implicated in disease.”**\n   * Don’t get bogged down by the technique or the system you want to study! But you can add more details depending on the type of program you are applying to. For instance, if it’s a more translational program, I would mention something about targeting those interactions therapeutically.\n   * **Make it clear WHY you have these interests**, and this is where your past research experience usually comes into play: how have the projects you’ve worked on shaped your interests?\n* **What makes you qualified for graduate school?**\n   * So the obvious answer is that a Ph.D. is a research degree, and since I have research experience, I’m qualified to pursue one. \n   * But what you need is **meaningful research experience**. And a decent amount of it. This means that you had a) **some degree of independence** (it was your hypothesis, your technique, or just a question you asked and answered in a predefined project), b) **you learned something** (not how to pipet, but you learned something about the project, the field, and yourself as a scientist), and c) t**here was some sort of outcome** like a poster/abstract, a paper (it does NOT have to be a paper, I was unpublished when I got into Harvard), or a talk. **Make sure you are proactive during your research journey: if you want to go to a conference or present, talk to your advisor about it!**\n   * See how none of what I just said has anything to do with anything technical? **That’s the sort of mindset you need to get into as you start working on your application** – anyone can run a gel or take fluorescent reads, but not a lot of people can communicate their work and its significance to a broad audience, formulate their questions or hypotheses, and design experiments to test those hypotheses. Those are the things that make you qualified for graduate study!\n\nWe talk about \"fit\" on here a lot, and sometimes it can be unclear what that means, especially when it isn't defined by the poster or commenter. In the context of this post**, fit is the applicant’s potential to succeed in the program and contribute meaningfully to that program through their research, academic, and social goals.** \n\n* **Research interests**: This is arguably the most important aspect of fit and it’s pretty boilerplate: is the research you want to do being done at this program? Note that I emphasized program – some programs will not let you rotate or do your dissertation research with faculty they have not appointed, so make sure you do your due diligence on the people you want to work with. It is best practice to look at faculty within the department/program regardless of their rotation policy with external faculty. This shows that you are invested in that specific program!\n   * The general rule of thumb is that you need to identify at least three faculty members with research interests that align with yours. If you can’t do that, it’s not a good program fit for you: move on. *(Don’t read every single paper of every faculty member of interest! Fun fact: I didn’t read a single one!)*\n   * If you find that dozens of programs don’t have at least three faculty members with your interests, your research interests are too specific for a rotation program: make them broader and re-evaluate or consider applying direct-admit.\n* **Research Resources**: If your research goal is to identify druggable-target systems, you’ll need a program that has a robust structural biology core (think the SLAC at Stanford) or is a part of a consortium that uses specific cores (like Brookhaven National Labs). You may also need a high-throughput screening facility or ready access to one.\n* **Program Structure/Culture**: This is something that a lot of people don’t think about (I certainly didn’t until I started working in a lab with graduate students!), but not all Ph.D. programs are created equal. Some programs require eight consecutive semesters of coursework while others only require two semesters. Some schools have flexible curriculums with minimal core requirements while others have a rigid class schedule with few opportunities to take electives.\n   * This may be a little further down the line, but the format of preliminary qualifying exams (“prelims”, “quals”) is also something that will affect you. Do you want to take it earlier in your graduate career or later? Would you be okay with an off-topic exam or an on-topic exam that directly relates to your dissertation work?\n   * Some programs emphasize a supportive, collaborative training environment with lots of guidance from a variety of offices (DEI, academic tutoring, etc.) whereas other programs don’t really have those mechanisms of support – think carefully of what type of training environment you would thrive in!\n* **Career Resources**: Remember that your goal after getting your Ph.D. is to get your dream job. Let’s say that you want to go on and become tenured faculty: Does the program allow Ph.D. students to or require them to teach? Does the program encourage students to write grants (e.g., NSF GRFP, NIH F31, HHMI Gilliam)? Is there an emphasis on scientific communication?\n   * These are all resources that will help you accomplish your goal of becoming a faculty member at a university someday and you need to make sure that the programs you are interested in have those resources!\n   * If you want to work in industry look for programs with networking and mentorship services for graduate students with industry professionals, translational medicine certificates, student organizations centered around start-up/innovation/entrepreneurship culture.\n   * That’s a lot to think about. Luckily, most of this information can be found on the program website, faculty profiles/lab websites, and graduate student handbooks. I also recommend writing this down in a Word document for when you’re actually applying (it made my life SO much easier when I was personalizing my SOPs). You will eventually need to narrow down your school list by September or October (*depending on how flexible your recommenders are, you can probably get away with some adjustments in November*).\n   * I can’t tell you how many schools you should apply to – that depends on your financial situation, recommenders willingness to fill out several forms, and your tolerance of filling out these applications (trust me, it can get very annoying, very quickly). All I can say is, with the current climate surrounding research, you **may need to consider casting a wider net than what was recommended in the past (15+ programs).**\n\n* **Letters of recommendation** are one of the most important aspects of your application (arguably more important than your grades and only slightly less important than your statement of purpose). The goal of this letter is for experts in your field (in other words, your faculty mentors) to inform other experts in your field (the admissions committee) that you will make meaningful, original contributions to their field once you are finished training.\n\n   * Therefore, it’s **critical** that your recommenders emphasize your ability to work as an independent scientist who is capable of problem solving, thinking creatively, asking your scientific questions, and, most importantly, being trainable. They are in the unique position to speak about your past as a trainee and how you most likely will be a trainee in a Ph.D. program.\n   * Whenever you have a research experience (whether it be as a technician, intern, or post-bacc), make sure you establish a good working relationship with your principal investigator. Ask to meet regularly or semi-regularly, take time to discuss your academic and career goals, and share things that are important to you as a person and scientist. When you leave the experience, keep them updated on what you’re doing and what you plan to do soon.\n   * This makes it easier to ask for that letter of recommendation when the time comes. **When should you ask for a letter? Ideally, six to eight weeks before the letter deadline** (some applications have different, generally later, deadlines for letters of recommendation), but I would err on the side of eight weeks. Personally, **I think the best time to ask if right after Labor Day** since it gives most professors a chance to settle into the new school year before getting bombarded with letter requests.\n\nThe hardest (and most crucial) part of your application is the statement of purpose. The goal of this document is to concisely tell the Ph.D. admissions committee why you are applying for a Ph.D. – What are you interested in studying in grad school, why are you interested in studying this? What do you plan to do after, and how is that program uniquely qualified to help you accomplish your academic, research, and career goals?\n\nYou have roughly 1200 words to touch on each of those things so every word counts.\n\nThe SoP can be broken down into three big chunks:\n\n**Introduction**\n\n* **The introduction to your statement (or anywhere in your statement) is not the time to wax poetic** about how you fell in love with science in elementary school. It’s not the time to share that you want a Ph.D. in neuroscience because you want to find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease which runs in your family.\n* Those and other personal reasons are all great reasons to pursue a Ph.D. in a biological science, but **the admissions committee doesn’t care (at least nine times out of ten) and typically it doesn’t come off as impactful as the writer intends for it to be**. We can share (cautiously) more personal reasons in the personal statement.\n* They are looking for a tangible, measurable, and reasonable reason for pursuing a doctoral degree. Just because you like science doesn’t mean you’ll feel motivated to finish a very difficult degree like a Ph.D. and, likewise, you may learn in grad school that it’s not easy to cure Alzheimer’s – what will keep you engaged with the science? What will keep you in the program?\n* I suggest writing a *brief* introduction (three sentences max) clearly stating your future career and research goals and state that you plan to achieve that goal with a PhD in XYZ field. Now, within the first thirty seconds of reading your statement, the reviewers knows exactly why you are applying for a Ph.D.\n\n**Research Experience**\n\n* **This is going to be the majority of your statement (\\~75%), so make it count.** If you have several research projects, I suggest picking two of the most relevant experiences and fleshing those out in detail. *(Note: If your program asks for a research statement in place of an SOP, it should adopt this format.)*\n* When you begin discussing your research, keep the narrative structure by setting up the experience before you get into the experimental details:\n   * When during your career did this experience occur? Was it in undergrad? Was it during your post-bacc or master's? Was it through an REU or other summer research program? Were you a tech? Did you receive some sort of award or fellowship to pursue this project? Where did it happen, and whose lab did you work in? What does the lab broadly do, and how did your specific research goal fit into the work this lab does? What previous work or data led to this goal? (use the AND, BUT, THEREFORE framework)\n   * By adopting this format, the reader can logically follow your research journey throughout the statement of purpose. If you decided to switch disciplines or systems, it’s easy to slide it into these short introductory sentences before delving into what you found.\n\nWhen you start to discuss your results, you need to make sure that it is not technical! This is where a lot of people begin to lose the admissions committee – **any scientist in any field should be able to understand your project from start to finish**, and a good way to test this is to have scientists outside of your lab read your statement and point out anything they don’t understand.\n\n* The best way to write your results is as a “mini-abstract” where you present what you did, *what you found*, and **what it told you**\n\n* Use the purpose of the experiment and not the experiment itself to demonstrate that you know why you did what you did.\n   * Western blot = measures protein expression\n   * EMSA/ITC/FA/SPR/BLI = tests binding affinity\n   * Cycloheximide chase = tests protein stability\n   * Co-immunoprecipitation = identifies protein-protein interactions\n* Take ownership and say “I” instead of “we”!\n\nBefore moving on to the next experience, make sure you share why your project is important for the field as a whole and to keep the narrative structure, you can also share any outcomes of the project (publications, posters, etc.) and how you grew as a scientist (first experience with benchwork, decided you really liked studying cardiovascular disease, etc.).\n\nWhen you transition into the next experience, make sure you loosely tie together those experiences in a way that makes logical sense. For example if you’re going from undergraduate research to some sort of post-bacc or master’s experience, explain briefly why you decided to pursue that experience instead of directly applying to graduate school and what you hoped to learn.\n\n**At the end of your final research experience, include a closing sentence that emphasizes how the experiences you’ve detailed inform what you want to pursue in graduate school.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* Start off by reminding the reader what you hope to study or accomplish in graduate school with the first sentence (likely just a rephrase of what you said in your introduction).\n* Transition into why this program is a good fit for you (not just research-wise! **mention how the program’s structure or curriculum, or required scientific activities, etc., make that specific program a perfect match**)\n* Tell the program who you can see yourself working with and why. Is it because you worked on something similar beforehand? Are you interested in taking a new approach to the same system? **(Remember to keep it brief and general and mention at least 3 PIs)**\n* Be sure to include other things about the program that you like! If you are interested in scientific outreach, mention that you can’t wait to mentor high school students in your thesis lab through a specific program. If you want to be faculty one day, talk more about your interest in their teaching fellowships.\n* **Have a strong concluding sentence that emphasizes your commitment to that program’s academic community.**\n\nSorry for the lengthy post, but I wanted to be as thorough as possible! I only touched on the LORs and the SOPs, but I'm happy to answer any questions about staying organized/my timeline, my personal statements, CV, or expand on any of the points I made above. I can also talk about my interview process, but maybe when the cycle gets closer to interview season! Like with all advice, this is anecdotal from my experience - I understand that **graduate school admissions is not one-size-fits-all** and something that worked for me, may not have worked for others and vice versa!"

    "body": "I had an idea about writing this post a bit ago, mostly as a way to laugh at the wild, inadvisable course that I took for my application cycle. I was extremely fortunate to receive 3(!) MD acceptances this past month, so I guess I can write this post now. I am still kind of in shock and so excited, especially after such a wild cycle where I felt like everything was going wrong. \n\nTo be clear, I definitely don’t recommend following in most of my footsteps - most of these are generally considered “rules” for a reason. However, I wanted to put this out to encourage anyone who also struggles with unexpected craziness, imposter syndrome, and the general neuroticism of it all. Obviously everyone’s experience is different and there are way too many factors to make any determination based on my experience. n = 1 and YMMV, but I wanted to put it out there that you can make a lot of “mistakes” and do things “the wrong way” and still achieve your dream! Absolutely you should try to get your best foot forward as much as possible, but failing to do things according to plan does not automatically mean your app is dead in the water. Don’t beat yourself up too hard over small (or big) issues along the way - the cycle isn’t over til it’s over!\n\nFor context: I had a 4.0 GPA and 513 MCAT. Went to a tiny rural liberal arts college that almost no one has heard of. I had about 250 research hours if you reeeeeally fudge it and I was pretty open on my app about the limited research opportunities at my school. I had good non-clinical volunteering hours, including a long period of dedicated work with my church. I had a few hundred clinical work and volunteering hours, but a lot more expected hours than completed. I had a few key experiences and ECs that were particularly unique and ended up being what the majority of my open-file interviewers wanted to ask about. \n\nAnyway, without further ado, here is my list of the holy premed rules that I broke with reckless abandon and still managed to get accepted so basically nothing means anything and it’s not over till it’s over:\n\n1. Apply Early\n\nI sort of did - or at least I tried. I had pre-written my personal statement and most activities, but once I started getting final feedback before submission, I felt like they needed a lot more work. I took a few weeks really polishing them and ended up submitting the last week of June. That’s not super late, but because of a weird transcript issue, I wasn’t verified until August 23rd. However, I feel like that extra time working on my primary was SO WORTH IT and I felt really happy and proud of it when I submitted.  \n\n\n2. Pre-Write Secondaries\n\nNot only did I end up getting my secondaries kind of late because of the extra time it took to get verified, but I hadn’t prewritten anything. Like, not a single word. I think I maybe looked over the prompts for one school, but that was it. I got most of my secondaries while I was out of town and started them a few days later once I got home. I started with 20 schools, then added more later to ultimately apply to 33 schools. Because of this, I basically ended up spending 3 months straight writing secondaries in any free time while also working full-time and also in between a few interviews toward the end. Ngl, this SUCKED. Did it stop me from getting accepted? No. Was I ultimately happy with the time I took to craft what I considered really solid essays? For sure. Would I ever recommend this approach? ABSOLUTELY NOT.   \n\n\n3. Submit Secondaries Early\n\nMy average secondary turnaround time was 32.4 days (yes, I calculated this on my cycle spreadsheet because what else would I do with my time now). Even removing one strong outlier (74 day turnaround on BU who sent theirs before I was even verified and the week of my MCAT), takes my average turnaround to 31.13 days. For anyone curious, the turnarounds for the schools I was accepted to were 30 days, 51 days, and 13 days. Turnarounds for the other schools I got interviews at and haven’t heard back from yet were 21, 30, 18, and 50 days. So did it stop me from getting interviews? Definitely not. Did it hurt my chances of getting more interviews from other schools if I was complete earlier? Who knows. Probably. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ \n\n  \n4. Early MCAT \n\nI started really prepping for the MCAT in December 2023, then immediately got COVID and officially started in January 2024. I didn’t schedule my MCAT for a while and ultimately scheduled for June 1st. I struggled to be consistent with my study schedule while also trying to pad my hours with clinical work and volunteering. I was also juggling several other tests throughout the same period, like my MA certification, PREview, and CASPer. I also got an ADHD diagnosis partway through my prep and spent the remainder of it going through the whole medication adjustment process. Thankfully, each adjustment helped my productivity MASSIVELY, but I ended up pushing my date back twice and eventually taking it on July 13th, so I hadn’t even taken it by the time I submitted. Oh, and my AC went out two days before test day and I got five hours of sleep the night before. I was bummed that I didn’t reach my goal score, but honestly I was super proud of how far I came with all of that going on (baseline score was like a 495).\n\n  \n5. Effective MCAT Prep\n\nI think I definitely did my best with what I had at the time, but I basically did everything that everyone says is a surefire recipe for burnout. 12 hour study days, no days off except the days I was working, minimal social life, no real downtime without it hanging over my head. I also did all the AAMC practice tests within like, a week and a half. I did FL 3, 4, and 5 basically 3 days in a row and did not spend much time reviewing at all. PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS. At that point, it was the week of my MCAT and I already knew I was doing things very inadvisably and I was so burnt out and ready to just power through and be done. It really came down to not having another choice because of how little time I ended up having to cover everything I needed to. Ultimately it all worked out okay, but in the most stressful way possible. This is most of the reason I didn’t pre-write my secondaries. Ya girl needed a break!\n\n  \n6. Apply Early (again)\n\nAfter submitting my initial 20 schools and finishing most of the secondaries, I added 13 more schools, several of them on the day of their primary deadlines. I had FAP for my first 20 and wanted to find time to research any other programs before paying to add them, but I wanted to prioritize secondaries. I submitted to one T15 school on their deadline, took a month to get the secondary in, and then unexpectedly got an II a week later. Again, this is not the most likely scenario. But the late submit didn’t kill my app! \n\n  \n7. Do Interview Prep and Mock Interviews\n\nI did sign up for an application service that included essay help, peer support, and mock interviewing. However, I found it very unhelpful leading up to my primary submission and ended up refunding it before I used any of the interview or secondary resources. I did do some prep before my first few interviews, but honestly I didn’t have the time to really look into mock interviewing options and the idea of trying to practice within my husband sounded even worse to me than with a stranger. I can explain my low-maintenance interview prep approach if anyone wants, but overall, it’s about knowing your strengths and I thankfully seem to naturally interview pretty well. I had some interviews with small things that I wished I’d said or added, but overall none that I feel like I bombed (so far 😬).  \n\n\nTLDR: I broke a bunch of the premed “rules” that you’re supposed to follow and still successfully got into medical school! I don’t necessarily recommend any of these particular choices, but I did the best with what I could do and it worked out for me! All this to say, try not to freak out over a few issues, or even a lot of issues. Try your best to put forward your best application, but mistakes and less-advised approaches do not automatically disqualify you. Everyone’s cycle looks different and your story and representation of yourself are way more important than arbitrary guidelines or ideals. Try not to lose hope and good luck, future doctors!"

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a 19-year-old college sophomore currently majoring in Chemical Engineering, and I'm really at a crossroads right now. I'm making this post after failing my physics midterm (still have C in the overall course), so I might not be thinking straight but I'm on the verge of dropping out. This semester has been a nightmare. Sorry for the length.\n\nA little backstory, I got an almost full ride (full tuition for 4yrs, a year of free housing, and an additional $500 a semester) along with an outside scholarship that gives $3000 a semester as long as I stick with engineering. However, a dangerous roommate situation severely impacted my GPA and academic performance, nearly causing me to lose these. I was put on probation last semester, I got a 3.2 GPA after being on probation (and moving to a studio), but this semester my grades have tanked to around 1.25 (A in one class, F in 2 others). I've been struggling with everything from a daily 8AM in-person lecture (after biking 7-15 minutes in cold, even rainy/snowy weather), extreme burnout, undiagnosed mental health issue(s) that I've struggled with since middle school that have only gotten worse in college, I can't speak to people normally, insomnia (but for some reason I fall asleep if I attempt to seriously study), poor financial management (last semester I only ate one meal a day but now I have to eat like 2-3 or else I feel hungry but rent is almost $2000/month and I don't have a job or car).\n\nSince I've already been on probation I doubt they'll give me another chance if this semester tanks. I'm starting to seriously question whether I should stick with engineering or switch majors, or even consider leaving college altogether. I'm grateful for the 24k engr scholarship, but I despise it at the same time. I passed Calc and Chemistry, and I've never struggled in a Biology class, so I should've just majored in that. I was top of my class when I did a CNA program at a tech college during high school. The risk outweighed the reward and now my GPA's about to be in hell, and I won't even be able to get federal aid. I hate ChemE major so much.\n\nThe work is hard and requires a level of thinking and processing time that just isn't suited for me. It's not that I don't get the concepts but it takes me too long to learn them, so I always end up behind. Then I feel stupid after the tests have passed because of how I missed questions that I can now easily comprehend. I hate the way my professors look at me when I ask a question, like they can't understand the words that are coming out of my mouth that sounded so clear in my brain. I hate being ignored by professors when I reach out to them in emails. I hate how these motherfuckers act so superior to people just because they're a professor.\n\nI’ve been looking into certificate programs (like dental lab tech or pharmacy tech) because I want a job with a stable, repetitive routine where I don’t have to deal with the chaos of customer service or constantly shifting responsibilities. Ideally, I’d love a role where I can work semi-independently and eventually afford my own small place (like a one bedroom/studio) in a safe neighborhood, with enough to cover healthy food (I’m tired of having to eat junk cause it’s more affordable). I don’t want a 6 figure income or to travel constantly or have a whole bunch of clothes and tech, etc. I just want the basics and to be safe and away from my family.\n\nI’m also considering trying to land an online job, even though my work history is limited to a few customer service positions (the longest being 6 months). I’m not sure if companies would consider me seriously given my age and the fact I’ve mostly done customer service. If anyone has experience or advice on how to present myself for online roles—or what sites are best for finding such jobs—I’d really appreciate your input.\n\nTL;DR: Should I try to switch majors and keep pushing through college, or is it better to consider alternative career paths like a certificate program or online work, even if it means facing some judgment from others? How can I best set myself up for stability and independence given where I am right now?\n\nThanks in advance for any honest advice or similar experiences you can share. Truly any advice is welcome be completely honest."

Not surprising, and  I think it’s pretty clear the same thing is happens at the high school level, too. It’ll be interesting to see how things shake out. \n\nETA Full Text: \n\nTHE PERVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF THE EASY A\n\nIn the era of grade inflation, students at top colleges are more stressed than ever.\n\nAUGUST 28, 2025\nDuring their final meeting of the spring 2024 semester, after an academic year marked by controversies, infighting, and the defenestration of the university president, Harvard’s faculty burst out laughing. As was tradition, the then-dean of Harvard College, Rakesh Khurana, had been providing updates on the graduating class. When he got to GPA, Khurana couldn’t help but chuckle at how ludicrously high it was: about 3.8 on average. The rest of the room soon joined in, according to a professor present at the meeting.\n\nThey were cracking up not simply because grades had gotten so high but because they knew just how little students were doing to earn them.\n\nLast year, the university set out to study the state of academics at Harvard. The Classroom Social Compact Committee released its report in January. Students’ grades are up, but they’re doing less academic work. They skip class at a rate that surprises even the most hardened professors. Many care more about extracurriculars than coursework. “A majority of students and faculty we heard from agree that Harvard College students do not prioritize their academic experience,” the committee wrote.\n\nAnd yet, these students report being more stressed about school than ever. Without meaningful grades, the most ambitious students have no straightforward way to stand out. And when straight A’s are the norm, the prospect of getting even a single B can become terrifying. As a result, students are anxious, distracted, and hyper-focused on using extracurriculars to distinguish themselves in the eyes of future employers.\n\nOf course, plenty of Harvard students are still devoted to their schoolwork, and rampant grade inflation is not unique to any one college. It affects all of elite academia. But Harvard is a useful case study because administrators have examined the issue, and because as goes Harvard, so goes the rest of the sector. \n\nAnd now Harvard is, at long last, embarking on an effort to reverse the trend and make its programming more academically rigorous. In doing so, it’s confronting a question that would be absurd if it weren’t so urgent: Can the world’s top universities get their students to care about learning?\n\nThe road to grade-inflation hell was paved with good intentions. As more students applied to Harvard and earning a spot became ever harder, the university ended up filling its classes with students who had only ever gotten perfect grades. \n\nThese overachievers arrived on campus with even more anxiety than past generations about keeping up their GPA. Students sobbing at office hours, begging their professor to bump a rare B+ to an A–, became a not-uncommon occurrence.\nAt the same time, professors were coming under more pressure to tend to their students’ emotional well-being, Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard’s dean of undergraduate education, told me. They received near-constant reminders that Harvard was admitting more students with disabilities, who’d matriculated from under-resourced schools, or who had mental-health issues. Instructors took the message as an exhortation to lower expectations and raise grades. Resisting the trend was hard. Few professors want to be known as harsh graders, with the accompanying poor evaluations and low course enrollments. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker told me that, 20 years ago, he gave a quarter of the students in his intro psych course an A or A–. Then students stopped signing up. Now almost two-thirds of the class are in the A range.\n\nThe pandemic only made matters worse. In 2011, 60 percent of all grades at Harvard were in the A range (up from 33 percent in 1985). By the 2020–21 academic year, that share had risen to 79 percent. Students were more anxious than ever, so professors further eroded norms to help them.\n\nTaken together, this has led to a regime in which most students get near-perfect grades, but the grades mean something different to everyone. Outside observers might still think of grades as an objective assessment of a student’s work, and therefore a way to differentiate between levels of achievement. But many professors seem to conceive of them as an endlessly adaptable participation trophy. Claybaugh recalled a recent talk with an experienced science professor who told her that some students get A’s for excellent work. Others get the mark because they’re from less-privileged backgrounds and demonstrated improvement throughout the semester. \n\nAnd still others get A’s because they were doing strong work before a mental-health crisis derailed their progress. “So pretty much everyone gets A’s,” Claybaugh told me. “That’s where we’ve ended up.”\nWithout the threat of poor grades, students have largely stopped trying in their courses. Pinker told me that student performance on the multiple-choice portion of his final exam (which he has kept mostly the same) has declined by 10 percentage points over the past two decades, even as he gives out more A’s. \n\nAn incoming Harvard junior, who requested anonymity to avoid affecting her future job prospects, told me that, for all the hand-wringing about student self-censorship, her peers mostly don’t read texts closely enough to form opinions in the first place. “I feel like college has become almost anti-intellectual,” Melani Cammett, a Harvard international-affairs professor, told me. “This is the place where we’re supposed to deal with big ideas, and yet students are not really engaging with them.”\n\nThat easy A’s would lead students to phone in their coursework should have been predictable. What’s genuinely surprising is that the system has also failed to reduce stress. The percentage of first-year students who have received counseling has nearly tripled in the past decade. This tension nagged at me during my own time in college. I graduated from Yale two years ago. While there, I experienced many of the same dynamics that Harvard professors and students described to me. The classes were mostly easy. Hardly anyone did the reading. We could all expect to be rewarded with an A or, at the very worst, a B. And yet students were always panicking. It felt at times as though campus was in the throes of a collective psychotic break. It wasn’t until I graduated that I, like Harvard’s professors and administrators, came to see these issues—lax grading, high stress—as connected.\n\nWhen everyone gets an A, an A starts to mean very little. The kind of student that gets admitted to Harvard (or any elite college) wants to compete. They’ve spent their lives clawing upward. Khurana, the former dean, observed that Harvard students want success to feel meaningful. \n\nGetting all A’s is necessary, but insufficient.\n\nThis has created what Claybaugh called a “shadow system of distinction.” Students now use extracurriculars to differentiate themselves from their peers. They’ve created a network of finance and consulting clubs that are almost indistinguishable from full-time jobs. To apply, students submit résumés, sit for interviews, and prepare a fake case or deliverable. At this point, the odds of getting into some clubs within Harvard are similar to the odds of being accepted to the college in the first place. The Harvard junior told me that she hadn’t considered going into consulting or investment banking before she arrived in Cambridge. But because the clubs are so exclusive, everyone wants to be chosen. She ended up applying. “There are a handful of clubs that you can just join, but the clubs people want to join are typically not the clubs everyone can join,” she told me. “Even volunteering clubs or service-oriented clubs have an application process. They’re highly competitive.” Things have gotten to the point where some students feel guilty for focusing on schoolwork at the expense of extracurriculars, she told me.\n\nMax Palys, an incoming Harvard senior, told me that coursework doesn’t prepare students to answer interview questions for finance and consulting jobs. The only way to get ready is through extracurriculars or on one’s own time. By sophomore year, his friends were fully absorbed in the internship-recruiting process. They took the easiest classes they could find and did the bare-minimum coursework to reserve time to prepare for technical interviews.\n\nThis hypercompetitive club culture advantages students who come from fancy high schools. Maya Jasanoff, a history professor and a co-chair of the Classroom Social Compact Committee, pointed out that Harvard devotes considerable resources to helping less-privileged students succeed academically. But that kind of assistance is useless to the extent that extracurricular clubs, which prioritize students who already have experience, are the coin of the realm.\n\nNow that they know that making college easier doesn’t reduce stress, Harvard administrators are attempting to rediscover a morsel of lost wisdom from the ancient past: School should be about academics. In March, the faculty amended the student handbook to emphasize the highly novel point that students should prioritize their schoolwork. The university has advised professors to set attendance policies and make clear that students, contrary to their intuition, are expected to come to class. And it formed a new committee to consider how to rein in runaway grade inflation. The committee is considering proposals such as switching from letter grades to a numerical scale (to get rid of students’ frame of reference) or reporting grades as the difference between what a student earned and the course median. In the meantime, Claybaugh has asked each department to standardize and toughen its grading policies. Faculty will need to move collectively so no one gets singled out as a harsh grader.\n\nFixing grade inflation, however, is easier said than done. Princeton, for example, experimented with an informal 35 percent cap on the share of A’s that professors were expected to give out. It abandoned the effort after a 2014 faculty report found, among other things, that the policy made it harder to recruit students, particularly student athletes. Beginning in 1998, Cornell began including courses’ median grades on student transcripts. Far from mitigating grade inflation, the practice only made the problem worse by giving students extra insight into which classes were the easiest. Last year, the faculty senate voted to end the policy.\n\nClaybaugh assured me that Harvard is committed to bringing about a lasting culture change around learning. She thinks of the change as a matter of fairness. Harvard students have access to a trove of intellectual treasures and the chance to commune with many of the greatest living minds. “If we have the world’s biggest university library, then our students should be reading these books,” Claybaugh told me. “And if the students we’re admitting don’t want to read those books, or if we have set up an incentive structure that dissuades them from reading these books, then that is immoral, and we need to reincentivize them to do so.”\n\nIf Harvard is to succeed where Princeton and Cornell failed, it will be because the political environment has given its initiative an extra level of urgency. The Trump administration’s assault on elite institutions generally and Harvard in particular has put the university’s public standing at stake. Claybaugh believes that the best way to help Harvard is to acknowledge its flaws and try to fix them. Bringing rigor back to the academic mission seems a natural place to start. “We should be making sure that we are living up to our mission to restore our legitimacy in people’s eyes,” she told me. “I don’t want people all across America thinking, It’s a place of ideas I find somehow troubling or offensive, and also, no one goes to class.”\n\nRose Horowitch is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\nDavid A.

    "score": 109,
    "url": "https://reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1ifd3xd/what_you_really_need_to_know_about_being/",
    "body": "If you’re reading this, you know the entire college admissions process is riddled with challenges. Letters of recommendation. Essays. Interviews. Activities. Applications. All of these hurdles inspire anxiety among college-bound students. But none seem so nerve-wracking as the threat of having your admission rescinded.\n\nThe threat of being rescinded — when a college revokes its offer of admission to a student — is scary for a reason. All that hard work and stress for nothing? Kids often wonder, *what did that person do to deserve that? It must have been something really bad. Unless it wasn’t. Oh no, what if it was only a little bad? What if I do something only a little bad and I lose my spot?*\n\nI find there’s a bunch of confusion surrounding being rescinded. To be clear, at most colleges, offers of admission are conditioned upon several factors. Those offers can be withdrawn at any time if those conditions aren’t fulfilled. This is because the college wants to make sure that students take their commitment to the school seriously. They don’t want to admit students who work hard only when they want something or who demonstrate certain values only to gain acceptance.\n\nFor example, a college might rescind admission if a student’s academic performance takes a dive in the last semester (and I mean a dive). It isn’t just about grades either — a college might rescind admission for non-academic behavior. If you get into big trouble, such as by engaging in criminal behavior or doing something really, really stupid that undermines the picture of the person you claim to be, colleges often don't like that very much.\n\nYes, [being rescinded happens](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/6/18/parkland-student-rescinded-harvard-2023/). But it’s not as common as you might think. And if a student has done something that draws negative attention, the university will more often than not ask for an explanation. But let’s not go there, ok? I mean, let's just avoid being rescinded altogether.\n\n# Here’s how:\n\n**1. Keep your grades up.** You can’t slack off your last semester. Try to maintain your grades as much as possible. You don’t want to put all your hard work in jeopardy just before you cross the finish line. I've had more than a handful of students (or their parents) contact me because their admission to a college was rescinded over Cs or sometimes even multiple Bs. So, it happens. Be careful. Here’s a clear rule of thumb: don’t go down over one letter grade per class, and don’t do that in more than a class or two.\n\nHowever, know that one bad grade isn’t the end of the world. If you earn a lower grade in a class or even two, during your last semester despite your best efforts, you’ll probably be ok, especially if your other grades remained steady. Again, bad grades happen. They can happen at any time. Colleges know you have a whole other semester left when they accept you. IF your grades take a dive and you’re rescinded or asked to explain them, be open and honest. I’ve had students write letters about family obligations or health emergencies that took over their lives, and they just couldn’t keep up the grades they’d historically made.\n\nIt’s important to be transparent with colleges about aspects of your life that have had an effect on your report card: limited access to the internet and technology, members of your household who’ve been struggling with physical or mental health issues, and economic problems are all real issues that students sometimes must cope with, and colleges understand the potential impact on your application and your grades -- even this last semester. So be prepared to explain what’s happening to you. Important Note: Explaining your situation is NOT making excuses. Colleges want to understand the context of your experiences, and if you don't share them (or have your school counselor do so), there's no way the colleges can have any understanding of your experiences.\n\n**2. Don’t be messy on social media OR DO or SAY anything that harms others. It will probably be posted on social media by someone else.** Generally, you should focus on being a good person, but you especially need to be careful during your senior year, especially on social media. Jeff Schiffman, the former admissions director at Tulane, [explains](https://tuadmissionjeff.blogspot.com/2019/03/some-thoughts-on-social-media.html): “The most frequent reason I rescind admissions is dumb stuff you do on social media.” He goes on to explain that admissions officers aren’t trolling social media waiting for you to slip up — they don’t have to. Someone will send them a screenshot of something offensive, and that’s how it starts. He goes on to say, “Being a jerk on social media to your peers or your community” is something he has no patience for.\n\nI think you can just extend that to just don’t be a jerk, full stop. Look, of course, we all have our moments when we act like jerks, but the fact is cell phone videos get posted or sent to colleges all the time. You don’t want to be the kid who has to explain their language choices to an admissions office. You don’t want to be that kid who has to learn the lesson the hard way that your words matter, and they can be hurtful. More than a few future seniors have had their applications rescinded over the last few springs and even summers and falls for their behavior and words -- either posted to social media by them or others.\n\nSo, for example, while you and your friends may think your humor is raw and it’s a blast to be super edgy on TikTok, Snap, or Instagram Stories, the Amherst or Georgia Tech admissions office might feel a bit differently. Don’t let it get to that point.\n\n**3. Don’t engage in criminal behavior – that includes underage drinking and drug use.** I’ve worked with a handful of students in the last couple of years who have had to work very hard to explain their second semester (often prom night) drinking charges. Colleges will usually reach out to verify that you haven’t gotten any criminal record of any kind since you applied. You don’t want to have to fess up to that night when you were just plain stupid and got caught.\n\n**4. Stay clear of academic dishonesty.** Here’s another one I’ve seen more than once. [Students get major senioritis and super tired of school](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1i9sbyj/handling_your_senioritis_and_other_admissions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and the urge to cheat to just get it over with gets strong. Fight the urge. You are almost at the finish line here, and cheating – whether it’s using a friend’s notes, buying a paper, using Chat GPT to help with your essay, or writing the answers on your hand is just not worth the anxiety of getting caught and reported to your college.\n\n**5. If something does happen and your college comes looking for answers, come clean.** If your college has concerns, they’ll ask you what’s going on, which allows you and your School Counselor to offer a valid and reasonable explanation. If it’s about grades, talk about how you learned your lesson and how you’ve learned to manage your time more wisely. You can say that you got in over your head, and you have learned how to deal with that situation. Explain that if you catch yourself in a bind in college, you will immediately go to the tutoring center and meet with your professor and TA.\n\nIf you did something stupid or mean or illegal, own up to it and talk about how you understand the gravity of your offense. Assure the college that you learned something, and you have changed for the better. Reiterate that you made mistakes, learned a painful but important lesson, and you are now ready to steer your academic and behavioral ship in the right direction. Talk about how your experience will make you a better college student now.\n\nFor whatever reason (and I hope this never applies to you), if your application is rescinded, reflect on what happened, learn from the experience, grow from what you learned, and move on to the next experience. Unfortunately, if it gets to that point, that’s all you can do. But please, please, PLEASE know that being rescinded is not common, and if you keep your eye on being a good and kind person and finishing the school year strong, you won’t have to worry about it at all.\n\n**TL;DR:** Being rescinded isn't common, but it does happen, so keep up your grades and don't succumb to senioritis, be kind,  and don't do stupid stuff.\n\n💻 If you want to learn more about the possibility of being rescinded, I talked to u/ScholarGrade about it on my YouTube Channel. It's worth watching to hear his wise advice. [Here's the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzYeSYRCwAM)."

(i'm reminding you again that at a \"feeder school\" like mine, people would FLIP if i said i wasn't particularly interested in going to most t10s.) when my parents heard, they were shocked. i was called lazy, insecure, and scared... solely because i couldn't see myself thriving in a cutthroat environment.\n\ndeep down though, i know i'm doing the right thing for myself. i fully believe i'll end up somewhere that's the best fit for me (because my pre-9th grade self didn't know any better, but my 12th grade self does)!\n\nas for the actual process... not bad at all. my ED rejected me, but that's okay. i’m just waiting on my RD round of targets and safeties. life will go on. everything's gonna work out one way or another — i know it, and we're all so close to it, whether you can relate to this post or not.\n\nTL;DR: my competitive high school destroyed my self esteem for like three and a half years on end, but the good ol' reassessment of my environment (via college apps) helped me regain my footing and orient myself for the future.\n\n(sorry for the coke rant, and ofc, full disclosure... the fact that i am even posting this comes from a place of privilege. without the opportunities i've had access to, i would be nowhere near where i am today)"

Don’t get me wrong—everyone was **incredibly impressive**, and I respect their experiences, but sitting through long, personal (private) stories while trying to stay engaged was exhausting.\n\nThe biggest issue? **It didn’t feel like a real interview.** There was no natural back-and-forth, no follow-ups, and by the time it was my turn, my train of thought had already derailed. To make matters worse, we were hit with **multi-layered, compound questions** in a limited timeframe. By the time I finished answering the first part, I had already forgotten what the second half even was.\n\nOn a personal level, I felt like my **central message got lost.** Seeing others get praised for certain qualities made me feel like I had to **subconsciously overcompensate**, which is *not* how I wanted to present myself.

Instead of an **objective evaluation**, panel interviews often lead to **inconsistent assessments** and subtle favoritism even if the school tries its best to limit its' implicit bias...we're still human.\n\nHonestly, **panel interviews should not be a thing.** They don’t allow for genuine, meaningful conversations, and the whole experience felt like candidates were just rushed on **reciting their resumes** instead of showcasing who they are, why they chose medicine, and what truly drives them.

    "body": "I'm currently seeing lots of posts on here about people debating turning down higher ranked schools for lower ranked schools. As someone who did this (>10 years ago now), I wanted to share my perspective now that I'm well on the other side of college and into my career. \n\nWhen I applied to college, I was very fortunate to have excellent results - I got in nearly everywhere I applied, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford (except Duke, where I am pretty confident I was yield protected lol). I also received a full merit scholarship to my state school (UNC-Chapel Hill). \n\nI received the UNC scholarship before I got in to any other schools (I didn't apply early anywhere, only regular decision). I was pretty sure that no matter what happened with my other schools, I was going to take the UNC scholarship (because I did not qualify for much financial aid). But then when I opened acceptance after acceptance, it was both exciting but also devastating knowing I was going to have to turn down these places that I had dreamed about attending for years and years. It was really hard at the time but I accepted the scholarship at UNC and tried to not look back.   \n  \nTo be honest, the first year at UNC was a bit difficult while I adjusted to the huge state school experience and questioned whether I made the right decision. But bit by bit, I feel absolutely in love with UNC. I made wonderful friends, had fantastic relationships with my professors, and really felt like a part of a special community. I was able to excel at UNC, and graduated with opportunities I could never have dreamed of, like multiple full ride scholarships to tip-top graduate schools. I'm now a professor at a T10 university and I credit so many of the opportunities I've had to the fact that I chose UNC and was able to really stand out there. \n\nAll this to say, I've recently spent a lot of time in fairly 'elite' academic circles - whether through my prestigious grad scholarships or working at a T10. And the range of universities that the highly successful people I am fortunate to be surrounded by is really astonishing. So many of the smartest and most successful people I know did not go to the best of the best universities. Yes, those places can open some doors for you and provide you with lots of connections into an elite world, but by excelling at a lower ranked school, you absolutely can get many similar opportunities. I now do grad school admissions as part of my job, and a student from a T100 with an great GPA, strong references, great research and/or work experiences has every bit the same chance as getting in to our program as your typical applicant from a T10 school. \n\nThere was also another advantage of going to UNC in that I was saved a bit from the competitiveness and GPA/EC 'rat race' that you find at many elite universities. I had a 3.9 GPA in a STEM major during undergrad, but I don't remember ever being super stressed about my grades or specific coursework. At UNC, I felt pressure to be involved on campus and seek out leadership positions, but there wasn't much academic competitiveness nor any sort of overwhelming emphasis on your coursework and grades. This was SO good for me as someone who was hyper-competitive and grade-focused in high school. I was recently talking to a friend of mine from UNC who went on to a T3 medical school about how different our undergrad experience was from our grad school friends who went to T10s. We really think our successes in grad school were largely driven by the fact that we weren't overly stressed and burned out when we finished undergrad. \n\nMost importantly, once you get to college, all your achievements 'reset', so to speak. None of my post-college applications for grad school, jobs, etc, had even one ounce of information about anything I did in high school. While this can seem intimidating for someone who really excelled in high school (it was for me at the time), please know that it's not like you become a different person in college and in all likelihood you will be able to continue on your success. Mostly though I'm just trying to tell you that (1) you absolutely do need to keep working hard in college to be successful but (2) do not let anything you did or didn't do in high school hold you back from achieving your goals. \n\nI'll end there even though there's far more I could say about my experiences. But I really want to reassure those of you on this subreddit that where you go to college does not determine the trajectory of the rest of your life, and it is what you do there that matters. Best of luck to you all!"

    "body": "Every year lots and lots of applicants are deferred from some of their favorite colleges. It sucks when life doesn’t go your way for sure, but maybe it helps to know that you’re not alone?\n\nNow, what do you do with that deferral? For starters, it's important to focus on whatever you might still need to do for your regular decision schools. And, there are lots of amazing schools still taking applications, where you can find and be your awesome self – I’ll be making posts throughout the semester with lists of colleges still accepting applications. Remember, you have you wherever you are.\n\nHowever, if you are, indeed, still interested in a college that has deferred you — and the school doesn’t specifically ask you not to write one or send one, start thinking about your letter of continued interest (LOCI). Some amazing advice from u/ScholarGrade: “it's hard to take the time and energy to actually send something. So many students don't bother because they see the stats on how few students get in off waitlists and just give up. Don't let this be you. I also once heard a Cornell AO say that they don't really bother looking at deferred applications where no update was received because they figure that if you really want to go there, you'll send something. TL;DR - Send something. Actually, do it. You have nothing to lose, and it could change your life.”\n\nIf you’re still reeling, or even grieving, from the effects of the excitement of December Decisions mutating to becoming December Deferred, you’re not alone. And while you can’t force yourself to feel happy, you can do something fun -- dance, sing, eat ice cream, and wear funny clothes. That definitely does not mean pushing bad feelings away. It just means giving those feelings a break. I recently wrote a couple of posts about how to deal with admissions stress:\n\n[What to do when decisions don’t go your way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1hexrz9/hello_beautiful_seniors_if_early_admissions_2024/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[College admissions decisions, wind, and why a little stress just might be good for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1hdging/college_admissions_decisions_wind_and_why_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Emotional Planning](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1h9uc7z/hello_class_of_2025_if_you_applied_early_its_time/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI know many of you have strong support systems among your families and friends, but if you find yourself struggling, you might find something that speaks to you in those posts. And you can always reach out to me, too. Here’s a great [blog](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2020/12/02/what-does-being-deferred-mean/) from Rick Clark, former Director of Admissions from Georgia Tech; it's about dealing with the stress of admissions and life, not specifically about how to write a LOCI, but some of you might find it helpful. Aside from the fact that he mentions Reddit (I’m sure he must mean A2C ;)), he always has amazing wisdom to share. I’m also going to share this [blog](https://tuadmissionjeff.blogspot.com/2011/12/ive-been-deferred-now-what.html) from the former Director of Admissions at Tulane about what to do if deferred.\n\n# Some LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest) guidelines from me you might find helpful:\n\n**Dos**\n\n1. Read the Instructions from the School: Use the method the college asks you to use in their letter. Some have a specific form. Some want you to upload to a certain place. Some have certain deadlines. Some say not to send anything at all. Read your letter carefully and check their blogs and your portal to ensure they haven't explained anything further.\n2. If they don’t say ***not*** to send something -- Send Something: If they *don't* mention your sending them updates or a letter to confirm interest in a certain format or say they don't want anything at all, send an email LOCI to your AO for your area or the dean of admissions if the college doesn’t have specific AOs for your area. Copy the general admissions office and the person whose name is on your letter. They might also have a portal for you to share anything they need.\n3. Keep it short and sweet. Do not take up too much of their time. I’d keep it within two pages, double-spaced (250 - 500 words). Make your points concisely and clearly. This is a little more business-like than your personal statement. You need to be polite, but also share your voice and be friendly and warm.\n4. Tell them they remain your first choice if they truly are. If you will attend if you get accepted, let them know this -- if it's true.\n5. Express your continued interest. Let them know that you are happy to be part of the regular decision pool now, and why it is such a good fit for you. Think of this part as a mini Why College Essay/love letter, and let them know what you can bring to their school specifically. It’s your job to paint a picture of yourself on their campus with specific details about how you will participate and be engaged with your college experience on their campus.\n6. Share any important updates to your application if you have them. Examples of applicable updates are improved test scores or grades, a visit to the college, a major award or honor -- or some personal goal you’ve accomplished this semester from a hobby or interest can also work.\n7. Thank them again and show your appreciation.\n8. Extenuating Circumstances: If you have or had any extenuating circumstances that could help them evaluate your application that you didn't address already, you could include it briefly here in your LOCI, or you could send a different email or submit it to the portal explaining your situation. Sometimes you don’t feel right in your application explaining hardships, but it’s the kind of information they need to know to understand the context of your application.\n9. Additional Letters of Recommendation: Some colleges will accept additional letters of recommendation if they explore a different area of who you are. Again, read their materials carefully. If they do accept additional LORs and you have someone who could write one for you to add something a little different, try to arrange that.\n10. Send it in mid-January, a couple of weeks after they are back in session. No need to send it much sooner. Your regular decision apps come first. If they have a quick form to fill out to acknowledge your interest, go ahead and fill that out and send it now. **Always follow the instructions they give.**\n11. Send an update to your interviewer: Thank them for their time, and just tell them you’re updating to let them know. Don’t expect or ask them to do anything, but maybe they’ll have some insight to share or advice.\n\n**Don’ts**\n\n1. Don’t send a letter if they tell you not to in your deferral letter.\n2. Don't send it before you've completed your regular decision apps.\n3. Don’t express anger or frustration. It’s ok to share disappointment briefly but don’t be whiny or pouty.\n4. Don’t make any assumptions about your acceptance or lack thereof.\n5. Don’t make your letter too long.\n6. Don't send regular updates. One or two updates are enough.\n7. Don’t ask the college for feedback on your application.\n\nTl;dr: 1) Send something unless the college specifically tells you not to. 2) Follow their directions. 3) Like everything else in college admissions, there is no magic formula. All you can do is get advice and then decide what makes the most sense for you. Others might have different advice than mine. That’s totally ok. You read it all and learn, and then figure out what works best for you.\n\nXOXOXO AdmissionsMom"

It's been hard getting out of bed; the summer seasonal depression had a major grip on me, and still is.  I was always late with my assignments, could barely focus and get myself to do anything.  Unfortunately, taking a total break wasn't an option at this time.\n\nI finished my final paper last night, and just got it in on time.  It was worth most of my grade, and I could barely finish it.  But I was able to and passed it in for a C+ grade.  The fact I was able to do this makes me feel proud, despite the grade not being an ideal one.\n\nIt should have been an easy A, or even an easy B.  It wasn't necessarily a difficult class, but dealing with a really bad mental health period made doing the work feel impossible.\n\nI'm going to the doctors this week to try to fix my meds and try to work through some issues.  I feel hopeful.  And while this grade isn't what I wanted; I was afraid of getting a worse grade.  So yeah.  I got a C+, and I feel pretty good about it.\n\nFor those of you in college and also dealing with mental health BS, I feel you.  I get you.  Give yourself some grace, you are doing the best you can.  I believe in you. "

    "body": "Hello Early Bird Applicants!\n\nIt’s Celebration Time! The first major early app finish line has passed, and I know you’re all ready for a break and a deep breath. So…. You did it! \n\nYou successfully completed and submitted your first round of early applications! There is so much for you to be proud of right now, and I want you to take a minute and acknowledge how far you’ve come and just what you’ve done. Submitting your applications is prime celebration time. Congratulate yourself for all the hard work you’ve done even to be able to apply to college – all the classes you’ve taken, homework you’ve done, tests you’ve prepped for, and activities you’ve balanced! Then, acknowledge how you’ve organized your applications, written about your activities, and explored who you are in your essays. That’s all worth a lot of ice cream, salty snacks, pats on the back, and so, so, so many high fives to all of you!!!\n\n**Some REAL IMPORTANT basic advice:**\n\n* Make sure your supplemental essays were submitted. Some colleges don't have the supplemental essays automatically submit when you apply -- you have to go back and submit them.  Check the pdf that was sent to the colleges. If those pesky supplementals didn’t submit, don’t panic. Just do it right now.\n* Most colleges have some grace period for your supplemental materials (including letters of recommendation), so don’t freak out if your transcript and other materials aren’t there yet (Not all colleges, though, so you need to check that on the college’s website).\n* Don’t go back and reread your apps over and over — you’ll find typos and little mistakes. You’re human, and humans make mistakes.\n* **Don’t panic** — they know mistakes happen. They happen every year.\n* But, if you do happen to find something that’s driving you batshit crazy or that really must be fixed, read from the college how to best update your application — usually, it’s on the portal or by email, but you’ll need to read the specific directions from each school.\n* If the college doesn’t say or you haven’t received portal info yet, you can send an “Oops” email and see if that works. Here’s how I suggest writing an “Oops” email.\n   * Send it to the general admissions email address and a copy to your regional admissions counselor if there is one.\n   * Use good judgment about whether to send it or not. For a typo or two or three, I’d leave it. Read above about their knowing you’re a human. Not a perfection machine.\n   * If you totally uploaded the wrong info or copied and pasted the wrong essay altogether, an “Oops” email might be worth a shot to you.\n   * Attach the update in a PDF. Make sure it has the full name you used on your application and the title of the piece you’re sending them to replace (Personal Essay, Activities Section, Additional Info, Supplemental Essay (add the prompt), etc).\n\nNow --- It’s time to let those early baby apps fly! You’ve poured your heart and soul into bringing them about and nurturing them; you have to let them go do their thing and make you proud.\n\nSo what's next? Even after your apps are in, though, you need to be sure you're covering a few things.\n\nThere are a few things you need to be taking care of -- even those of you who’ve submitted all your applications and you think you’re done :) Be sure to:\n\n1. **Open every email from all the colleges where you've applied**, and click on all the links. This is where they will share important info about your application with you.\n2. **Check Your Portals:** Most colleges have some sort of portal set up where you can upload any info you might need to share with them or they can send you messages. It usually takes a day to a few days to up to a week before you get the portal, and not all colleges have this; some just use email, but you should still be on the lookout for portal information from all your colleges and once you receive it, sign in and keep your login info handy! Be sure to check your promotional, social, and spam email folders. The portal emails often get stuck there. Provide any info colleges say they still need.\n3. **Know that it can take up to a week for supplemental materials to be submitted.** Add these columns to your spreadsheets so you can keep up with who needs what. Check your portals regularly, but not obsessively :)  -- to make sure they're not missing anything. That's how colleges will communicate with you.\n4. **Update Naviance/Cialfo/Maiai/Scoir/School Links/Your School Counselor:** Make sure you have checked that you’ve \"applied\" on your high school’s application platform or method they use (and for the early admissions option if you haven’t done that). (*If you've never heard of Naviance, Cialfo, Scoir, etc, it probably just means your school doesn't use that platform for applications, so no worries there.*)\n5. **Follow up with your School Counselor:** Make sure that all is good there and that y'all are on the same page and you've done everything they're expecting of you. Make sure they have a list of all the colleges where you’ve applied early and everything they need from you.\n6. **Check-in with your Recommenders:** Send them a brief email to let them know you’ve applied to your early schools, and how excited you are, and how much you appreciate their helping you on this journey. This can serve as a gentle reminder that they might need to send along your LOR, and you can see if they need anything from you to facilitate sending letters if they haven't yet done so. Be sure to send them a thank-you note at some point this fall. An email is fine, but teachers do love a handwritten note. \n7. **Check for Interview Info:** If your early colleges offer interviews, be sure to be on the lookout for emails, texts, and voicemail messages. Check all your email folders, search for the word interview, look in your junk text messages, set up your voicemail with an appropriate message, and make sure you have space to receive those messages.\n8. **Interview:** Do the interview. Stay tuned for a post soon about virtual and in-person interviews :)\n9. **Send Test Scores:** If you haven’t yet submitted test scores (if you are submitting test scores) and the colleges require official scores, do so now -- even for your regular decision schools. Don’t wait and give yourself that stress.\n10. **Ask Questions:** Consider reaching out to your regional admissions officers at the colleges where you're applying to say hello, introduce yourself, and ask any questions you might have. It’s okay to reach out to them with questions you can’t easily find via Google or on the website. Ask questions of the college's general admissions office, ask questions on [r/ApplyingToCollege](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/), DM me, and ask questions of your high school counselor. Of course, always read the websites, directions, and use Google, but don’t be afraid to reach out and ask -- especially if you’re feeling overwhelmed.\n11. **Engage with the Colleges:** Keep engaging with the colleges. Reach out if you have questions. Go to info sessions and virtual tours if you haven’t already. Check out interesting things to you on their websites. Read the school newspaper.\n12. **Open every email**, respond if you can, and click on those special points of interest they want to share with you!!! This is where they share important info with you.\n13. **Recharge your Batteries:** get outside, read a book, do yoga, have a dance party in your room, take long walks, hang with your family or friends, have a little bit of a Netflix binge, or meditate!!\n14. **BREATHE:** You did it! You’re officially an early app badass and a college applicant!\n\nIt’s getting real…\n\nTake care. Be well. Reach out with questions. I look forward to continuing to hear from those of you who like to reach out to me -- let me know how it's going -- or if you have questions!\n\n😊💙 AdmissionsMom\n\ntl;dr: It’s all important info. You need to read it. 😊\n\n[Share](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/early-app-finish-line-has-passed-whats-next-2024?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4NDQ5Mzc0LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNDk5MzY0NjAsImlhdCI6MTczMDU2NzA0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzMzMTU5MDQ4LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzY1NTYiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.AVZPiLDbjzysAVBpZWzUb653MlGDV-68kU3iWozAdq0)"

I have chronic autoimmune disease arthritis and this causes me issues with fatigue - severe pain which impacts my sleep. And alongside this got SA’d.  Which then caused an ED. I have an IP and have spoken to MH advisors at Uni and kept my PAT updated.  \n\nSo as you can probably imagine to even pass Y2 for me was a shock and surprise as I was not expecting it. \n\nI came out last year with 47% and only had to resit 1 module, so a 3rd. \n\nThis year I started getting more support from my family regarding my struggles as I had kind of just been hiding it and struggling by myself because I didn’t want to burden them with all of my stuff\n\nSo I worked my butt off this year and I have got high 50’s and low 60’s on every assessment, apart from 1 module.  \n\nAfter getting the grades back for my assessments, I calculated my grades online using the available calcs and managed to push myself to a 2:2 even with the ‘failed’ module within the calculations. \n\nI got my results on the 5th and I have seen that they haven’t dropped the module - and the only thing I can do is re-do the module with no attendance. \n\nI feel like I should be happy that I have this opportunity to proceed, but I just feel like my overall mental wellbeing is decreasing back down to when I was in Y2. I have no motivation, i’m sleeping all the time, my conditions flared again, I feel empty?? My eatings gone disordered again and I feel like shite\n\nI guess after all the waffle is, if anyone has been through my situation, what have you done to try and make the best of it and not feel like the world is crumbling around me. I wanted to go and do my teacher training and Phd eventually to work with SEN kids but I kind of now just feel like i’m kidding myself when I have failed my undergraduate. It is my fault i guess in the majority but I just feel like a joke. \n\nI wanted to graduate for my parents, and my nan. My nan has dementia and doesn’t have long left in reality but I wanted to be there to show her my gap and gown because I know that it would make her proud. I was the first person in my family to go to uni and i just feel like an absolute joke. \n\nWhat do you guys recommend to keep myself afloat? I have tried some different things I enjoy but I am struggling to enjoy anything. \n\nAnything would be appreciated. I know this probs sounds ridiculous because I get another chance but my brains just telling me it’s game over for me. \n\nThanks :) "

    "body": "I've realised that when applying to university that by just coming from a lower income background I've been priced out of nearly the majority of all elite universities. London for example is nearly impossible even on max loan, same goes for your edinburghs and Bristols and even oxbridge. Durham for a small town in the North can get to nearly 200 pounds a week I rent. Even places like Manchester are getting ridiculously overpriced and rely on the fact you get a bus from fallowfield everyday with a bus pass that costs 200 quid. \n\nI get A*AA In my alevels not the best not the worst but still I feel completely uncomfortable going to any of these places just due to the shear fact of how much it costs. It makes me feel bad that I want to prioritise saving for the future instead of going to an elite university but I dont know what to do, SFE as it is scares the crap out of me I am eligible for max but what if they screw it up and give me less or take too long.\n\n\n And no offence this sub can be great it's just hard sometimes seeing all these people going to top unis and being told you should too even though just so many of then seem completely out of my price range I don't wanna feel like a failure because hypothetically I chose a newcastle over edinburgh because its the only one I feel I could afford. Building on that being from the North their is a vast amount of distance one has to travel to get to these places, and when your there its quite understandably only the rich kids who can afford it who you are surrounded by which makes you feel like an imposter for even trying,  being in a city you can't afford across the country surrounded by people that in no way can understand your upbringing\n\n\n. Is it just me or does the whole thing seem unfair as if the whole prestige system is based around the majority of rich private schoolers who go on to do the best in life due to their up-bringing, sorry for the rant it's just that off recent I've been feeling trapped by the pressure to choose the right university for career that won't leave me or my family in financial strain. The only exception I can really think off is warwick but still that's kinda unfair in the fact you have to commute nearly an hour in 2nd and 3rd year from leamington spa."

    "body": "# AdmissionsMom's 2025 Timeline for (almost) Rising Juniors and Seniors\n\nHello Almost Rising Juniors and Seniors (*and almost rising sophomores hold on to this*)!\n\nThis is basically an abbreviated version of pretty much everything I say throughout the year; hopefully, it's organized in a way you can find useful.\n\nJunior year is where your college admissions journey starts for real. You now have quite a few items to tick off your to-do list.\n\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT:  Don't out if you're already a rising senior -- (or even a fall semester senior for that matter if you’re reading this much later). You still have plenty of time.\n\nPlease note that my views about what to do when and what I emphasize might be different from the advice you hear from other sources and other students, counselors, or consultants. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.\n\nHere’s how I suggest you tackle this list. If you are new to admissions, no matter where you are in high school, start reading here from the beginning. Don’t panic. It’s totally ok if you haven’t done any of the stuff on the list. Most kids haven’t. I’m just providing a timeline for “an ideal world” situation.\n\n# Rising Junior Summer (Summer before Junior Year)\n\nENJOY YOUR SUMMER: This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. Be sure to take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nACTIVITIES: I love what MIT Admissions says: \"Some students feel so much pressure to get into the “right” college that they want to make sure they do everything right—down to their extracurricular activities. Fortunately, the only right answer is to do what’s right for you—not what you think is right for us. Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don’t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy—whether it feels right for you. College is not a costume party; you’re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you’ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you’re ready to try.”\n\nGET INVOLVED WITH STUFF\n\n* Yourself (Exercise healthy habits, engage in personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, get a job, learn something new that’s good for your brains like guitar or Italian, practice mindfulness and meditation).\n* Your family (Help with sibs or grandparents, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, or take care of dinner one night a week).\n* Your community (Community service can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects. Volunteer to play your instrument or play games at a retirement home, coach a kids’ team, make sandwiches at a food bank, or make comfort bags and drop off healthy snacks and water to people who might not have access to housing).\n\nGET A SUMMER JOB: Just an old-fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.\n\nTESTING\n\n* PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT: You take it in October, and it helps you qualify for National Merit if you score high enough.\n* PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT: Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of your junior year. Definitely take one in the early part of the spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start your senior year.\n* Even though many colleges are continuing to be Test Optional, I encourage you to continue to prep for and take the tests because the list of colleges requiring tests is changing.\n\nSTART YOUR RESUME: If you haven’t already, make a list of all the activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. I suggest making a spreadsheet, where you have columns for the name of the activity, your title, your leadership, your impact, lessons learned or impact on you, years that you've been involved, and an estimate of your hours per week. Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old-fashioned summer or part-time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to more traditional research, internships, and in-or-out-of-school clubs and sports.\n\nEXPLORE THE WORLD OF ADMISSIONS: Read some college admissions websites and blogs. Some of my favorites are Georgia Tech, MIT, Tulane, UVA, Johns Hopkins, and Tufts. They are open about the realities and anxieties of college admissions.\n\n# Junior Fall\n\nPretty much all of the summer stuff still applies.\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nTAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN: You can read more about Course Selection [in my post, Making your Course Selections Count](https://admissionsmom.college/course-selection/making-your-course-selections-count-2023/). Colleges say your course rigor counts for more than your GPA and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. I recommend that you take four years of:\n\n* Science (including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)\n* Foreign Language (many highly selective colleges like to see four years of a foreign language during high school. I know you don’t want to. It’s also good for your brain. [Here’s a doc with my explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6EB7rSSrDV6ovPjl3ndD8Vc17cYt4Wlo3YkA5kiLOo/edit?usp=sharing))\n* English\n* Math (ending in Calculus if it’s available and offered (especially if you want to be competitive for highly rejective colleges) -- or higher)\n* Social Science (History, Gov, etc)\n\nCheck out the course requirements or suggestions on the web pages of some colleges that might interest you.\n\nGET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS: Visit them during office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. Speak up in class. Ask for help when you need it. Be polite. Say thank you after class. Acknowledge their hard work and use their wisdom.\n\nKEEP UP YOUR GRADES: I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials. Meet with your teachers after class. Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other YouTube videos if you’re struggling. Don’t wait and get far behind. Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now.\n\nREAD READ READ: Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. Read real books, magazines, newspapers, and more real books. Read books that are required for school and books just for fun. I can suggest lots — ask me! READ FICTION!!!!\n\nKEEP PREPPING AND PRACTICING FOR THE ACT AND SAT: Start your testing in the late fall or early spring of Junior Year if it’s available to you.\n\nSTAY INVOLVED: Keep up with everything I listed for summer (involved with yourself, your family, your community). [I talk at length about extracurricular activities and finding your star-shaped self in this post](https://admissionsmom.college/activities/). Get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or simply do individual activities that add to your school environment. Sit with someone new at lunch once a week. Make an effort to say hello to two new people a week. Find a need and fill it. Or, as [this Georgia Tech blog says,](https://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) find what makes you happy, and do it.\n\nCHECK-IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR: See what they have to advise and how the process works at your school. Every school is slightly different. Let them get to know you, too.\n\n# Junior Spring\n\nFOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH: [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nLETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. Some colleges have certain expectations for recommenders, so be sure to read college admissions websites about what they are looking for. For lots more in-depth info, [here’s a post about getting those Letters of Recommendation. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nCOLLEGE VISITS: Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you might consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Hang out on campus. Then, if you can go on college visits to schools you might find interesting, do so.\n\n* Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also wander around.\n* Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear?\n* Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night. Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospective student and, even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Move on and find a kinder person.\n* Check out the dining hall and the gym.\n* Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one. Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable.\n* If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get a feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.\n\nVIRTUAL VISITS: Most colleges have really upped their game when it comes to virtual tours, online info sessions, and their social media presence, so be sure to check out all the ways they are bringing their college to you on their websites.\n\nCOLLEGE LIST: Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but you can also learn a lot on the internet, social media, and by reading books. Besides virtual and live tours and info sessions, you can learn more about colleges here:\n\n* Reddit: here on r/ApplyingToCollege, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.\n* Colleges’ websites. Sign up to receive info and get on their mailing lists.\n* Common Data Set. Google “college name” and “common data set”\n* Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on Instagram, and Twitter, and TikTok. Clean up your account and use your real name\n* Colleges’ newspapers and news feeds\n* “The Best 300 Something Colleges” by Princeton Review\n* Trans and GenderQueer Friends, [this post is for you.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_oYp5PlIgVSVe9GTRrvcpBLmPy4emBqV/view?usp=drive_link)\n* Books! See below\n\nSOMETHING TO CONSIDER: Your SureFire Sure Bet Welcoming School -- Make sure you have at least one Sure-Fire Sure Bet Welcoming School and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity. A sure-fire safety school is a school:\n\n* where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions\n* AND you would like to go there\n* AND they are a financial safety\n* Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure-fire safety until you have already been admitted.\n\nI like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety out of the way. You must LOVE your safety. Research it and imagine yourself there. Remember the strength of your application is only as strong as your list. An unbalanced list is weak and will usually not be strong enough to hold up your college admissions experience.\n\nCOLLEGE FIT: Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big old list. Having a ton of schools on this initial list is ok. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter some of the schools out. Here’s the [link to my Step By Step Guide to Creating your List](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/whq4tn/seniors_two_posts_in_one_1_if_youre_feeling_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that goes into much more detail about finding colleges that fit you. [Check out this post filled with various college lists for you to explore.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pG1biX7AjKd3YH9LtSvdHg7jMW2zCBwE?usp=sharing)\n\nADMISSIONSMOM'S COLLEGE BOOK CLUB: (I don’t actually have a book club, but I wish I did. These are just a list of books you should read.) Here are a few of the books I recommend: *College Match* by Steve Antonoff, *The Fiske Guide*, *Colleges that Change Lives*, *Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be* by Frank Bruni, and, of course, [Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit, 2023 Updates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OB7agF8xFavMGxZ-nVrQKhAXh6yLh8Bp/view?usp=sharing) by me - (this is a link to the pdf for free, but you can also buy it at your fave booksellers if you want to hold it in your hands or read it on your kindle!).\n\nCOLLEGE RESEARCH SPREADSHEET: Include info like test score averages, requirements, distance from home, school size, programs that might interest you, climate, and anything else you feel might be important.\n\nNO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE OR TIME: Make a No College-Talk Zone or Time in your house. In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it. For other families I know, it might be all day on Sundays. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year. Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your home for the next year. That’s not healthy for any of you.\n\nNET PRICE CALCULATORS: Sit down with your parents and do the net price calculators for a few colleges on your list. Begin those tough financial conversations. Be sure to use the one provided on the college page itself. You can usually find it pretty easily by googling: “College Name Net Price Calculator).\n\nNEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS: Make a new college-only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! I recommend this because then all your info from colleges won’t get mixed up in your other emails. Also, colleges prefer to see a college email address so they can know you’ll still have it after school is out. Only use this email address for colleges you’re applying to (or considering applying to) and your Application Platforms like Common App or UC Apps. I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to this email address if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes, so you don't miss important info! [Be sure you’ve signed up for “more info” or to “request info” on the college’s websites with your new college email address,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing)\n\nCHECK-IN WITH YOUR SCHOOL/COLLEGE COUNSELOR: They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have its own processes you need to follow.\n\nCOLLEGE INFO SESSIONS: If a college comes to your town or close to your town or school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in. Also, be sure to check out all the amazing virtual opportunities.\n\nCOLLEGE FAIRS: Go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.\n\nWRITE: I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what? It’s not! Even the most timid of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early. I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.\n\n* Write Every Day. Even if it’s just a sentence or two.\n* Read and listen to essays on [This I Believe](https://www.thisibelieve.org/). These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects. I like that they aren't college essays.\n* Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on Reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you.\n* Avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays, and often when you read those, you can get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive, boring essays for the reader.\n* Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources.\n\nREAD BOOKS: Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes. Reading good fiction and also self-help books will help you learn to discover your voice. Here’s a list of fantastic books to read. Some are just for fun, and others help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing, and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays. [Here's a great post by](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nwij3j/books_to_read_that_mention_the_college_admissions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [u/SplendidCheese](https://www.reddit.com/u/SplendidCheese/), where they highlight some fun fiction books about college admissions. I've included a few in my list here, too.\n\n* *Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics* by Dan Harris and Jeff Warren\n   * *The Happiness Equation* by Neil Pasricha\n   * *You are a Badass* by Jenn Sincero\n   * *Brave Enough, Wild,* and *Tiny Beautiful Things* \\-- all by Cheryl Strayed\n   * *The Soul of an Octopus* (just finished it and loved it!)\n   * *Me and Earl and the Dying Girl* by Jesse Andrews ( I like his voice and it’s on a lot of banned book lists!.)\n   * *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig\n   * *Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow* by Gabrielle Zevin\n   * *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir\n   * *Lessons in Chemistry* by Bonnie Garmus\n   * Some fun fiction books about College Admissions:\n      * *This is Not a Personal Statemen*t by Tracy Badua\n      * *The Ivies* by Alexa Donne -- A2C gets a shout-out!\n      * *Girls with Bright Futures* by Tracy Dobmeier and Wendy Katzman\n\n* *Admission* by Julie Buxbaum\n\n* *Where the Grass is Green and The Girls are Pretty* by Lauren Weisberger\n\nTAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER: Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key. There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad. So, how do you deal with it? What do you do -- besides post and comment on a2c??? :))\n\n* [You are a BadAss College Applicant:](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/2024-college-admissions-decisions-wind-and-a-little-stress?r=3qhdg3) A post with a metaphor about baby trees and college stress.\n* [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n* Be involved. And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.\n* LEAN IN. Lean into your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress. Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it. Instead, face it and embrace it. If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience is so much about the journey and not the outcome. And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a particular school.\n* Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air. Eat Healthy Food\n\nOTHER… If you qualify, explore these amazing programs and possible options if you’re not already:\n\n* QuestBridge Program: [https://www.questbridge.org/](https://www.questbridge.org/)\n* Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program:[ http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/](https://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/)\n* The Posse Foundation: [https://www.possefoundation.org/](https://www.possefoundation.org/)\n\nJuniors, you are in for the journey of your lives. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible. Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming. Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger. I'm looking forward to watching your transformations! This is a prime opportunity for you to take advantage of digging in and getting to know who you are.\n\n# Rising Senior Summer\n\nThis is an important summer for you, but there is no magical formula of what you need to or have to do to get into any colleges-- even the most highly selective ones. Sure, you can research in a lab, get an internship, or do a program somewhere on campus or around the world. Those are all fantastic ways to spend your summer. You can also do independent projects – and I think you should – even in addition to whatever else you might be doing.\n\nBut, don’t forget the good old-fashioned summer job. You can actually stand out from the applicant crowd these days by making a smoothie, flipping a burger, or scooping ice cream. These kinds of jobs allow you to learn about taking care of others and listening to what the customer wants, learn about organizing your thoughts and activities, learn to work with others, and gain some experiences you might never have the chance to gain again.\n\nHere’s what William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Harvard Admissions, has said about summer: “Bring summer back... Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e., to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead.”\n\nFINISH TESTING: SAT and ACT (if possible)\n\nRECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES: Take time to care for your mental health and your body. Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Breathe. \n\nCOLLEGE-ONLY EMAIL ADDRESS: If you haven’t yet, be sure to make a college-only email address that you use for your applications and communications with colleges. See above in JUNIOR SPRING for a longer explanation.\n\nWRITE: “Write like a motherf\\*cker,” as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself. Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. See my WRITE from Junior Spring.\n\n[Here’s a list of questions to get you going](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LviZQkEwVd6_SY4-XlCMRpVRiCDL_rdC/view?usp=sharing). This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1. Check out [themostdangerouswritingapp.com](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app). Start asking yourself some hard and kinda silly questions. I’ve had students write stunning essays just by answering these questions:\n\n* What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?\n* What do you worry about?\n* What’s your secret sauce?\n* What’s your superpower?\n* When you’re in your room at night, what do you look at?\n* What makes you smile?\n\nTHINK ABOUT AND PRACTICE WRITING THE PERSONAL ESSAY: Remember — no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message — the topic is YOU. Focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are. Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader. You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value. They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application. Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources.\n\nMAKE A COMMON APP/COALITION ACCOUNT & any other accounts you might need: Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background. Those roll over when they update the website in August. DO NOT fill out college-specific info. It could be lost. Write your essays in a google doc. Do not write them in the app!\n\nUPDATE YOUR RESUME: Or create it if you haven’t done so yet. [Here’s a sample I use.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11MaObJv_8g3lIGj_80n97Wg36MVib2RaiLX8g3f76rc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nVISIT COLLEGES if you can: See information about College Visits and Virtual Visits in the Junior Spring section.\n\nSTART YOUR COLLEGE LIST: [Here’s a post about creating your college list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/whq4tn/seniors_two_posts_in_one_1_if_youre_feeling_lost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[.](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/my-2024-guide-to-building-the-best-college-list?r=3qhdg3) Start narrowing down your list — including a wide range of selectivities. Make sure you have at least three SFSB Welcoming Schools. What is a SureFire SureBet Welcoming School you ask? Well, it’s often your most important school. It’s one:\n\n* Where you have direct/auto/guaranteed admissions based on your stats\n* OR you’ve already been admitted via ED, EA, or Rolling\n* AND you can see yourself being happy there\n* AND it works financially for you and your family.\n\nREALITY CHECKS: You hear me say time and time -- time again -- that you cannot expect to be accepted to the most highly rejective colleges in the country -- no matter how brilliant your application and shiny and sparkly your essays and ECs and LORs are. I’m not saying don’t apply -- Do apply. Clearly, some of you will get in and I’m here for that. I’m just saying there are too many amazing yous out there, so you absolutely can not expect it. You’re a brilliant generation -- and now you’re gonna have to figure out a way to share your brilliance in ways beyond a tiny teacup of colleges that a defunct magazine ranks in order to stay relevant.\n\nKEEP IN TOUCH WITH COLLEGES: [Sign up to \"request info\" from every college you’re interested in](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing) — even if you’re already getting info from them because they bought it from a testing company. Use your college-admissions-only email address for this. Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Instagram and Twitter for the colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following Common App, too. Also, it’s ok to occasionally contact your regional college admissions officers or the general admissions office with questions.\n\n# Senior Fall\n\nAll of the above....plus:\n\nFinish up any college visits (or virtual visits) especially for EARLY DECISION POSSIBILITIES.\n\nCOLLEGE LIST: Begin to narrow your college list. [Make sure your list is balanced](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vuing4/its_all_about_finding_your_balanced_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and you have three SureFire SureBet Welcoming Schools (see above) that you love and that will be good financial fits, as well as a collection of matches, reaches, and lotteries (if that’s your thing). \n\nDEMONSTRATED INTEREST: Check the Common Data set to see whether the colleges on your list consider demonstrated interest. If they do, make sure you open and read every email they send you, click on links they send you, and spend some time researching on their websites. Also, go to webinars, campus visits if you can, virtual visits, and reach out to admissions with any questions you have.\n\nCOLLEGE APPLICATION SPREADSHEET: Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics — and look for overlap. Testing info.\n\nFILLING OUT APPLICATIONS: Start with the details if you didn't do it in the summer. Fill out activities, family history, etc.\n\nEARLY ACTION: Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available and that you can by following guidelines. Make a calendar of deadlines and essay requirements and work through them one by one.\n\nFAFSA AND CSS: Make accounts and start gathering and filling out information.\n\nFINANCIAL AID: Reach out to the financial aid offices of schools on your list and establish a relationship with them. Do the net price calculators on the college websites with your parents.\n\nLETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and \"cheat sheet\" if you haven't yet.)[ See linked LOR Post for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nYOUR SCHOOL COUNSELOR: Check in with your school counselor. They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have its own processes that you need to follow.\n\nSAT/ACT TESTS: Finish up any testing you have left to do. Be sure to check colleges’ websites for their last accepted testing dates.\n\nSUBMIT TEST SCORES: Submit your test scores in plenty of time for deadlines to the schools that don't allow self-report. Be sure to check the colleges’ admissions websites to find when they need to be submitted and whether they allow self-reporting or not. And for colleges that are test-optional, do your research to figure out whether you should or should not report. You can use the Common Data Set to see where your scores fit in. Use [www.fairtest.org](https://www.fairtest.org/) to find out whether a college is test-optional or not. [Here’s a link to my copy/paste I share with students when they ask about submitting scores.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnzg3Kc6cP08XxpYi6Slpjh-YhLIeqDHLNZK09z9WBM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAP SCORES: I suggest self-reporting AP scores of 4s and 5s and sometimes 3s. [Here’s my post about APs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ug130e/lets_talk_about_ap_tests_and_scores/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nESSAYS: Start writing your essays for real now. Focus first on your Personal Statement. Here’s a link to my post about writing the personal essay, [You Do Have an Amazing Essay Inside You](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/wta7e3/you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside_you_heres_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It’s filled with my advice and resources. Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates. [Here’s my post about Making Peace with the Supplemental Essays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xdbil5/making_your_peace_with_the_supplemental_essays/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). How many [“Why College” Essays](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14mevoYJi-mzDBiDOCqh4Sotiu_Bjz5mOpy7_Hc3zhQ0/edit?usp=sharing) do you have? When's the first one due? Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the Extracurricular Essays. Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1. Use an app organizer for this.\n\nINTERVIEWS: Be sure to check your email (and voicemail and trash and spam folders for interview invitations). Every school has a different method for signing up, so read their websites carefully. For some, you are automatically signed up when you apply. Others require you to sign up yourself or to apply by a certain deadline. In most cases, they are optional, and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity. I do suggest that you do them though if they are available to you — even if they’re optional and you’re nervous. Lean into your fear, admit it to them if you want, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go. [My Interview Post is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qotxxj/your_step_by_step_guide_to_interviews_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nEMOTIONAL PLANNING: If you applied early, prepare yourself for decisions that might not go your way. [My Post about Emotional Planning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nLOCI: If you are deferred Early Decision, be sure to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest) if you are still interested in attending that college. [Here’s a post about that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rz2tz4/so_you_were_deferred_what_to_do_now_its_time_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# Senior Spring\n\nThis post got too long, so I’ll talk about senior spring when we get closer!\n\ntl;dr\n\n* Junior year is when the college admissions prep really kicks in -- you got this.\n* Follow this guide while adapting it to suit your own needs\n* Check with your high school counselor.\n* Be involved.

    "body": "Hi Reddit. \nMy older sister had been in the process of applying to colleges all year, and got accepted to a bunch of them. She was accepted to a really nice prestigious school (college A) and was pretty excited about it, but waiting to commit until she got her waitlist descisions back. Long story short she narrowed it down to 2 options and decided on one that wasn't college A. The night before the deadline she was so torn, and I went into her room to discuss with her. She had basically decided on college B but was having doubts. Her gut was telling her to do college A but mind was saying college B. She was overthinking like crazy and it was really hard to watch. We discussed it until about 2 in the morning and I was telling her that both would be good but maybe she should trust her gut. She was unsure and decided to go with college B. My gut was telling me she had made the wrong decision but I made sure not to say anything or give off those vibes. I was super supportive of her decision to go to college B and made her a sweatshirt and everything. Fast forward 2 weeks and shes having major regret. She wishes she had said yes to college A and after much deliberation reached out to see if college A would let her go after all. My family has been waiting anxiously for the response email, but neither of my parents really know what the best decision would be. My sister said if college A said they didn't have space for her, she would feel closure and feel better about going to college B, but if they accepted her she would be excited to go to college A. They rejected her. She is devastated and crying all the time, I don't know what to do to help her. Should I email college A and tell them I am her little sister and that she is devastated? Or should I just let her be? Try to comfort her? Make fun of college A? Distract her? I'm so sad and it's so hard to watch her grieving. All I want is for her to get accepted to college A for the second time. What can I do to help make that happen? Thanks so much in advance I really need some tips. I'll read all your responses and am so grateful for them. Sorry to such a long backstory! \n\nEdit: I think a lot of her regret is based on telling people she went to a slightly less prestigious school then school A, and school A's reputation is more alternative which she likes. School A is also in the western part of the u.s. which she identifies with more but it has its drawbacks as well. She feels so much of her identity is ties up in where she goes and telling people. School B is also further from me, which is hard. "

The only thing I am thinking is that my grades are like in the 10-20% for some of these schools that I am interviewing at, and then with my MCAT up in that range the lower schools are just yield-protecting and deciding not to interview me.\n\nI have also had all my essays read by multiple docs, english majors, and the absolutely mythical u/ToastedButter from last cycle and I am really at a loss here.\n\nIf I don't get in this cycle, I will have to retake the MCAT because it will expire. I am really convinced that there is no point to retaking the MCAT and trying again because I will end up with the same result. Only getting interviews at these schools that are still a coin flip for the best of applicants, with sub 25% post-II rates. What do people think? Is it joever?"

    "body": "My mom is so ignorant and so out of touch from reality it makes me want to pull my eyes out of my head. I'm a current senior and my mother is overseas (Korea) while I'm studying here as an international, I've been looking into some very good civil or mechnical engineering programs like Purdue, Cal Poly Pomona, etc. Especially given our financial circumstances, I will still apply to those top schools like MIT or Ivys, but I've been trying to explain (with zero success) that you do not NEED to go to MIT or Harvard to be successful. Also she has zero concept of different majors being better in certain schools, like for example GT's engineering is far better than Harvard's, but in her mind it's just \"oh it's harvard it's more famous so it's gotta be better\" It's to the point she's telling me she won't pay my tuition if not for MIT or Harvard or any school that she \"knows\" (which is like 7-8 schools most of them in HYPSM or similar class only top of the top, btw). Mind you she is so ignorant with American college stuff that she doesn't even know CMU, Umich, Caltech, even those top schools she has no idea they exist. She has done zero research herself but is so arrogant she thinks it's easy to get in these schools just because whatever celebrity she sees on TV can and the fact that I \"study overseas\". Whatever I get into though, those schools are expensive and it's probably not the best idea financially to even go there. She literally thinks a school like Cal Poly or any school she finds \"not famous\" or \"never heard of it\" would end me up jobless and that nobody would hire me and that I shouldn't even bother continuing my education. Also, she thinks an an engineering major is far worse than a law or med school and would be a financial mistake, when in reality it's the same or better, especially in the US. I want to do engineering but it's not what she wants doesn't mean it's bad. She also thinks architecture is the same as civil engineering, in reality civil engineering makes much more but she has a negative view on it because her brother is an architect and makes no money, apparently. She doesnt consider the fact that first of all, Korea and US are different and Civil eng and architecture are two completely different fields. All she does is look at TV or \"people she knows\" and see all those famous people get in all these top schools she is so out of touch in how real life works and thinks that's all the world is. How the hell do I explain to this old and ignorant hag to stop being a Karen and actually listen to her son? (And yes, I am moving out of this household as soon as I can)\n\nu/Careful_Fold_7637 in response to your deleted comment: \"hag\" is generous considering she already failed tenfold as a parent in every way possible, I only call her mom because that's her current legal role and position, in reality she is a horrible person and abuser who beat me every week for the most trivial of reasons and to this day even after I left has little regard to my well being and is a complete control freak. She doesn't care about her son as a human being as she is only focused in fighting with other people legally which she spent fortunes on lawyers. Someone who treats her child as an asset for social and financial needs and not a human being with independent thoughts and wants does not deserve a child or deserve to be called a parent. She only barely makes up for what she did by providing for me financially. You might have had loving and supportive parents but you don't tell me what I cant say without experiencing a shit parent yourself"

My wife did ask him“If you major in biblical studies then what’s the end game at the moment?”  He chuckled a little bit, kinda shrugged and said I dunno.  I’m just a sophomore he said. When I asked why don’t you major in photography/media/digital media my wife said Messiah didn’t offer that major.  So now I’m thinking why doesn’t he major in some type of media while attending church/religious group at school thereby keeping close to his faith if it happens to not be a religious school.  Just a thought."

I finished my undergraduate degree strong, presented at more conferences, and continued doing good research. After graduating I got hired by two non-profits in mental health and committed to that work. I spent all summer investigating programs, emailing potential PIs, and drafting my application materials. This time I applied to nine Clinical Psychology programs across Canada. (In retrospect this was a waste - only two of these programs would have been an excellent fit.

Read more about their approach here:  https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/holistic-review/.  \n\nYour odds of admission can be significantly impacted by your choice of major.  Most UW students are admitted to the university and enter their major *after* enrolling.  The most selective and competitive majors admit freshmen directly. \n See more here:  https://admit.washington.edu/apply/admission-to-majors/\n\n#Essays\n\nIt's definitely worth checking out this page with their writing tips:  https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/how-to-apply/writing-section/.  In particular, here's a few things to note:\n\n1.  You have to copy your Common App personal statement into their \"Writing\" section as a supplemental essay - they will not see it in the Common App Personal Statement section.  \n\n2.  Their Writing section does not support italics, double spacing, or some other formatting.  Your essays here will be rendered as plain text.  That's usually not a problem and does not require adjustment, but if you have any words or phrases where italics were important, you can use quotation marks or capital letters where appropriate.\n\n3.  They tend to like a more polished and \"professional\" approach compared to other colleges.  You should still be personal with the insights you're sharing, but you may want to consider modifying some phrasing to make it less casual in tone.  UW also more heavily considers grammar/syntax than other colleges and highly recommends editing and proofreading.\n\n4.  UW takes a stronger stance on the use of AI than some other colleges.  For example, [Georgia Tech considers ChatGPT to be similar to a free consultant/editor when used to critique writing](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2023/07/27/seniors-can-we-chatgpt/) (obviously, they don't allow you to claim its work as your own).  But UW says, *\"All writing in the application, including your essay/personal statement and short responses, must be your own work.  Do not use another writer’s work and do not use artificial intelligence software (ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) to assist or write your statement.\"*  As such, I do not recommend using AI in any capacity for your UW application.\n\n#Ask Me Anything\n\nCurious how to enhance your chances of admission to UW?

Now I'm just stuck in a position where I don't have any achievements or awards aside from good grades. Based on in state and out of state tuition, I have to go to in state, and the best in state university is KU. \n\nAs a person who had always been raised with the \"you're going to go to high places\" the whole thing is just difficult for me to digest. \n\nDoes anyone know how to cope with the anxiety and let down? And also, does KU offer any good scholarships?\n\nEdit: Thank you for everyone that replied. I genuinely didn't expect this much response. To clarify, I don't think KU is a \"bad\" school, or look down on it. And really, I'm very grateful that I'm getting an education, even if I don't sound like it. It was just that all my life I have been told of schools like the Ivys, Stanford, UCLA, etc, and I guess subconsciously I thought I was going to those schools. I know, I know, stupid. \n\nIn truth, my anxiety is complicated, with my career choice, my parents and their disappointment and upcoming death, comparisons, and regret and more anxiety. So I thank you all for being supportive and encouraging to make the most of it. \n\nAnd yeah, I am the \"gifted kid who didn't live up to their potential\". \n\nI won't deny it; it's going take a long time to grow out of my mentality. I'll probably have regrets even years after my high school, thinking of all I could've done, and all I didn't do. But I'll try. Try out both pharmacy and computer science as well, intern, and see what exactly clicks for me. \n\nSo, on that note, Comp Sci and pharmacy majors, how exactly is work like, and what are some pros and cons?\n\nAlso, I'm a girl, not trying to be annoying or anything, just saying since some people have defaulted to \"he\". \n\nAnyways, any good ways to grow out of the mentality? Tips during job applications and transfers?\n\n+Edit2: For more information about not knowing the holistic review and immigrant family thing, it meant that my parents were immigrants, and I was too, but I grew up in the U.S. for most of my life so I consider myself American.\n\nBut the thing was my parents were terrible at English, didn't know much about the school system in America, didn't have time for me since they were busy with work, etc. Both of them weren't good at technology as well, and for context they were both born in rural areas and way before the more common phone came out.\n\nI spent most of my childhood without a father since he was still in his home country(my mother and brother+I came the the US first) and my mother was busy raising both of us by herself so she never had time to properly study, have social interaction, or just do anything much.\n\nAnd then, my father quit his job.\n\nNo warning. No notice. He just showed up one day having quit his job. \n\nHonestly speaking, as a daughter to my mother I would be lying if I said I didn't hold any hard feelings for this man. As a person to my father, I do know he was dealing with being burnt out and wanting to see his family. Anyways, this brought our family to an financialy unfavorable situation. Eventually, we had to move to an apartment.\n\nLater, but not before we moved to the apartment, just when I was still young, my mother attended a community college. That left me with a brother that was going through a pretty severe teen phase and would always bother me, causing me stress, and a father that tossed me a phone.\n\nDuring middle school, when I first got my computer, as well as the potential for becoming more aware about clubs, COVID came in. I think I don't need to elaborate more on how that affected my awareness.\n\nAnd yeah, I got to high school, got good grades but no extracurriculars or awards. Had about nothing to write on a college transcript.\n\nIf you had told me the word Holistic a few weeks ago, I would have assumed that was an era in history somewhere, maybe specific to like Rome or Greece. \n\nTbh I don't think this explains well, and I would like to point out that I do blame myself for the majority of my problems. I hope that clears it up. "

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nKind of embarrassed to be taking this to Reddit but I’m not sure what else to do. Essentially I’m a freshman in college right now. Throughout high school I made it a big priority to go to a top school, so I got incredibly high test scores, good ECs, volunteer hours, etc. Senior year I ended up getting into 3 top 20’s (don’t wanna call them out so I’m not identified but no ivies or HYPSM but pretty much next best schools, also important to note I didn’t ED anywhere then and even from ivies was pretty much universally waitlisted) and was pretty excited. \n\nWhat I didn’t anticipate was how expensive the cost would be. Tbh I was down to take out loans but I ended up getting a really competitive scholarship in state that covers my full cost of attendance and then some (room, board, stipend, tuition, etc.). Despite my adversity to taking it pretty much everyone around me pressured me into doing it (parents, teachers, even my friends who ironically were wealthy and all going to T20s and didn’t apply for said scholarship) so I ended up taking it.\n\nFor context, my state school is very bad. Our research is okay but otherwise we pretty much have no connections to any major employers or grad programs. Despite having like 20k students per class, I’d say only 20-40 students make it into good next steps after graduation per year (good jobs, grad school, med, etc). Still, I decided to attend and make the most out of my situation. However, upon actually getting here I’ve realized there is a reason our graduates aren’t very successful. I could rant about all these reasons extensively but in summary: alumni network is shitty and the few successful alums do not care about their alma matter, no industry connections (like basically not a single Fortune 500 company at our career fairs), none of the clubs actually do anything, no culture around academics/studying, etc. I’ve made some friends and stuff but I have yet to meet a single person more accomplished or intelligent than me (and I don’t really identify heavily with either of those things.. so it’s a bit concerning). The school culture is horrible and doesn’t align with my personality at all.\n\nI kind of anticipated not loving the school and planned to just tough it out to graduate debt free, but I never imagined how much my environment would actually affect me. I genuinely feel like my life is over. I’m hopeless and depressed, no longer want to learn, and genuinely am considering dropping out. I know it can be hard to adapt to college, but I’ve struggled through many hardships in my life and have never felt this way, I don’t think this is a normal amount of anxiety. I am crying 24/7.\n\nAll this to say, what next steps do I take? Do I try to finish out the semester and then transfer? Do I just drop out now and try to re ED to another school? I was originally scared of losing my scholarship but given how bad my mental state and academics are I just want to get out of my situation and try to find something else. \n\nI was thinking of EDing to Brown or UPenn since those were my original top choices but idk if that’s too risky of a bet considering I got waitlisted RD last year.\n\nI’d appreciate any advice, thanks."

    "body": "Wow, this is exciting!  You just got the glossy mailer inviting you to apply to a *very prestigious* summer camp!  And it will be held at an Ivy!  With real, live Ivy ^(affiliated) professors teaching it!  Surely if you can somehow scrape together the low five figures they're asking for, this will all but cement your admission to that same school or other T20s come senior year...right?\n\nThe no-longer-secret truth about these programs is that they won't really help your application to a top 20 college.  And that's good news for most of us.  Quite often, the selection criteria for these programs is primarily (or even totally) driven by your ability to pay for them - I've taken to calling them **\"Summer Paygrams.\"**  They admit the vast majority of applicants, and do not typically offer opportunities and experiences that admissions offices will regard as distinctive or compelling.  It's quite possible for your parents to sign you up for one of these, and for you to go through the motions doing the bare minimum as a warm body in the room.  There may be no initiative, leadership, or even effort or engagement on your part.  And for some students, that's part of the draw - they get something they think looks good on their resume without much work or thoughtful planning, and it's a lot easier than blazing your own trail.  At the end of the day, there's very little impact to your college application, which is in direct contradiction to the biggest reason I've seen students and parents interested in these.  If you're a very strong applicant to top colleges, then attending a summer paygram probably won't hold you back.  If you're not a strong applicant, a summer paygram probably won't make you into one.\n\n#Pros and Cons of Summer Paygrams\n\n**Pros**\n- It's all planned for you.  So you don't have a litany of decisions to make or accountabilities to hold yourself to.  You can relax and enjoy the structured program.\n- Exploration.  You'll get a chance to see a college campus, dive into some classes and activities related to the topic/theme of the camp, and meet some interesting people.\n- It's better than bingeing Netflix or playing video games in your mom's basement all summer.\n\n**Cons**\n- It's all planned for you.  And admissions officers know that you didn't really achieve much - you mostly just showed up. \n- Opportunity cost.  You often can't take on as many other opportunities with your summer, so you need to think carefully about whether this is on your list of things you really want to do.\n- Financial cost. Many of these are crazy expensive - I've seen some over $20K+.\n\n#The Difference Between Quality Programs And Cash-Grab Paygrams\n\n>*\"How do I find the good summer programs that are actually worthwhile and will actually help make my college applications stronger?*\n\nAt the bottom of this post, I've listed out many of the best summer programs and very high quality options.  I have a similar set of criteria for evaluating programs as MIT does, and these are a good way to assess any program's value, especially from a college admissions perspective.  There are many excellent programs that will not manage to fully meet all of these factors.  But these are the best criteria for assessing quality and value.   The best ones are:\n\n- **Free** - The best programs are free or offer generous need-based financial aid.  There is a very nearly inverse relationship between the cost of a program and the value it brings to your college application.  Many of the best programs will even offer stipends to cover incidental expenses.  Note that a program does not *have* to be free to be high quality, but if an expensive program doesn't offer need-based aid, that's usually a strong indication that it's a paygram.\n\n- **Selective** - Programs admitting more than 80% of their applicants tend to be significantly less valuable that those with admit rates below 20%.  These rates are not often published, but many programs will have some indication of selectivity, or they will have limiting eligibility requirements.\n\n- **Intellectually Compelling** - You should learn meaningful content, find your curiosity or inquisitiveness encouraged, and be given opportunities to explore material at a deeper level. \n\n- **Educationally Rigorous** - You should be challenged and held accountable for being fully engaged.  The best programs will mirror the rigor of undergraduate study.\n\n- **Community Driven** - They should intentionally foster a great community of like-minded peers and a student cohort that is interesting and inclusive.  Both the students and faculty should support the culture of learning & rigor, emphasis on interpersonal connection, community vibe, and communal enjoyment of sharing passion and geeking out over the subject together.  There should be opportunities to get to know other students, develop relationships, and continue discussions.  At the best programs, attendees tend to stay in touch afterward and even reconnect in college.\n\n- **Enriching** - You should walk away with a profound sense that the experience was worthwhile and that it deepened your interest and understanding of the subject matter.\n\n- **Fun** - This is your life, and you only get one.  You don't want to waste a summer slogging through something you hate or killing off any spark of interest in the topics or subjects you're exploring.  Good programs find ways to make the experience enjoyable, and most students are sad when it's over.\n\nIf you want to spot the worst programs and avoid borderline scams or costly mistakes, consider the opposite qualities to those listed above.  Programs which check too many off this list are probably not worthwhile:\n\n- **Expensive** - Little to no financial aid is offered, and the price tag is in the high four to low five figures.  Paygrams.\n\n- **Open Enrollment** - Many expensive paygrams will admit 80% or more of their applicants with some admitting anyone willing to pay.  This means enrolling some students who are unmotivated or unqualified. \n\n- **Intellectually Bland** - There are few if any opportunities for deeper engagement with the material and subject matter.  They simply push through the planned syllabus. \n\n- **Educationally Light** - The program and content are clearly catering to the lowest common denominator of admitted student, and that's not a high bar to clear.  Little to no material is presented at the college level and is instead simple and introductory.  Students' main responsibility is to show up rather than to demonstrate mastery, think critically, or apply the knowledge and skills they're learning.\n\n- **Siloed or Individualistic** - There is little community or culture to speak of.  Most students were sent by their parents and are just there to check the boxes.  Faculty are there to get through it and collect their paycheck. Opportunities for personal connection or continued discussions are limited or performative.\n\n-**Inert** - The goal is completion of the program, not a richer understanding of the subject, an engaging experience, or an enhanced skill set.\n\n- **Boring or Tedious** - The classes are dry and plodding.  Assigned exercises are geared toward regurgitating information rather than applying it in creative or innovative ways.  When the paygram finally ends, both the students and faculty are relieved.\n\n#FAQ\n\n>**How many selective summer programs should I apply to?**\n\nThis depends on how much time you have available, how competitive your application is, and how determined you are to land a spot at a good program.  Most of my strongest and most determined students apply to 8-15 programs, partially because most of the essays are substantially the same.  It also depends on how many programs you actually find interesting.\n\n>**Everyone knows these \"paygrams\" are a terrible value, especially for college admissions.  Why are you wasting time talking about this?**\n\nFirst, while it's no longer a secret, there are still hundreds of people who don't know or find out too late.  Below are some actual things parents have said to me during consultations:\n\n- \"Our daughter was admitted to a really great program this summer at Harvard, so obviously that's going to really boost her chances at Ivies.\"\n\n- \"This program sounds amazing, but not quite affordable - I just wanted your thoughts on whether it's worth financing it with a loan?\"\n\nSecond, the list of programs below will introduce many high quality options that may not be on most students' radar.  Check it out.\n\n>**\"Are the best and most selective summer programs worth applying for?  Will they actually strengthen my college application?  It seems like a lot of work.\"**\n\nThe best summer programs are absolutely worth it both because of the experience and opportunities and because top colleges recognize their value, rigor, selectivity, and distinction. There's a bit of chicken-and-egg to this because incredible students are more likely to get into top summer programs and also more likely to get into top colleges.  But the following examples of students I worked with aren't coincidental:\n\n1.  A student I worked with last year who attended SSP got into Harvard, 5 UCs (including UCLA & UC Berkeley, with Regents at 3 of them), and was offered a full ride from USC.  Her only rejection was Stanford.\n\n2.  One of our students this year who attended SSP is a finalist for multiple full ride scholarships and just got a likely letter (call) from Yale.\n\n3.  The last student we worked with who attended RSI was admitted to nine T20 colleges.\n\n4.  A few years ago we worked with a student who attended a highly selective medical research program.  Despite not being in the traditional \"top tier\" of applicants, they were admitted ED to Northwestern.\n\n5.  Our last student who attended BeaverWorks was admitted to 3 Ivies and 7 T20s.\n\n6.  Another way to consider this - every student we've ever worked with who attended one of the programs listed below was admitted to one or more T20s.  That doesn't mean these are guarantees of admissions success, but it's not nothing.\n\n>**\"HELP!  I attended or am about to attend a paygram!  How can I make it worthwhile?\"**\n\nMany paygrams are fine for what they are - they just aren't going to materially improve your college application.  Some give you real college-level coursework or have elements that fall on both sides of the list of criteria I shared above.  If you're considering a paygram, the real question is whether you value the program itself and what you'll learn there enough, and whether you'll make the most of it.  But if all you're looking for is a way to boost your college applications, there are other things that would move the needle more.\n\nYou should consider these the way colleges will consider them, namely, that the impact and depth of engagement is what matters, not the fancy-sounding name brand or the fact that you were a warm body in a chair at a summer program for a few weeks.  Even an outstanding and selective program won't move the needle much if you aren't able to demonstrate that you learned, explored, achieved, created, etc.  And even the lesser programs could still be quite worthwhile if you really apply yourself and make an impact. \n\nSo for example, if your college application lists that you went to a quality program like MIT MITES, but doesn't share any details about what you learned, accomplished, or valued, it's not going to really change their assessment of you all that much.  But on the other hand, if you go to a low-profile, for-profit, open-enrollment (non-selective) coding camp and learn Ruby on Rails, BUT then use it to build a complex and impactful mobile app for an organization you're involved in, that would be a significant accomplishment.  It would show that you have a strong work ethic, take initiative, and own your education, using your skills to make a difference.  It would show that you can take responsibility, lead practically, learn meaningful things, and apply them.  As I've said before, the impact is what matters, not the hours, brand name, \"impressiveness,\" or presentation. \n\nAs it happens, the best, most selective, and highest quality summer programs are usually the ones that also provide the best opportunities for impact.  Many of the for-profit ones are more about going through the motions, checking boxes, and looking impressive than they are about actual impact.  No matter what kind of program you attend, I think the best things to do are:\n\n**1.  Approach it intentionally.**  Don't view this as merely an opportunity to get the \"Ivy+ brand\" listed on your resume.  Don't just show up and go through the motions.  Instead, be purposeful, engaged, and focused.\n\n**2.  Think about what you want out of the program, then look for opportunities for that.**  Are you looking to network with other students or profs?  Build a particular skill set?  Learn and explore more deeply into a particular topic? \n\n**3.  Find a way to independently apply something you did or learned in the program.**  Like the example I mentioned before, if you can take something you learned and then apply it on your own in a different setting or context, that's fantastic and would show that you truly got value out of the program and made the most of it.  You might not be able to say for sure what this would be or what it would look like beforehand.  But you should ask yourself, \"after I finish this program, what are the next steps?  Where do I go from here?  How do I build on this momentum?\"\n\n**4.  Worry less about how you might present or \"spin\" something, and more about what you really want to do.**  If you're pursuing things you love because you love them, then you don't need to spin that.  You can just be honest about who you are, what you love, and what you want to pursue.\n\nTo give you an example of why the above are important, top colleges obviously want students who are high-achieving academically and have demonstrated that they are fully capable.  BUT they despise the idea of pursuing strong grades or academic accolades as a rubber stamp of approval.  They are repulsed by the idea of a student doing something just because it will look good on a college application.  They want intellectual vitality - a persistent curiosity, engagement, and pursuit of topics and fields you love, not because you think they're impressive or anything, but simply because you love them.  They want sincere passion, deep interest, and exploration & learning for its own sake.\n\n#The Best Summer Programs\n\nBelow is my list of programs which, in my opinion, are high quality and have a lot to offer, especially from a college admissions perspective.  To varying degrees, they perform well against most or all of the criteria I listed above.  Check them out and put together your own list of the ones that are the most interesting to you.  There is no order to these, and since these programs are subject to change each year, there may be some that are no longer offered or have changed in material ways.

Many of them are fantastic, but there may be a few in these lists that lean into the category of expensive, non-selective, go-thru-the-motions camps.  So use these lists to find the ones you're interested in, then do more research on those to determine if they meet the criteria outlined above (enriching, fun, selective, intellectually compelling, educationally rigorous, community driven, and are either free or offer generous need-based financial aid).\n\n•\tNational Conference of Governor's Schools Summer Programs:  https://www.ncogs.us/programs.html.  These are listed by state. \n\n•\tQuestBridge Summer Programs - These summer programs have partnered with QuestBridge to provide full funding for QuestBridge College Prep Scholars.  If you're eligible for QuestBridge (strong academics, <$65K household income, minimal assets), I HIGHLY recommend checking this out.  If you are not eligible for QuestBridge, it's still worth checking out their list of partner programs because many are fantastic.   https://www.questbridge.org/apply-to-college/programs/college-prep-scholars-program/scholarships-and-awards/summer-programs\n\n•\tMIT's list of year-round STEM programs & opportunities:  https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/stem/\n\n•\tDavidson Institute list of gifted summer programs:  Day Camps.  https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/gifted-summer-programs-day-camps/\n\n•\tDavidson Institute list of gifted summer programs:  Residential Programs.  https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/gifted-summer-programs-residential/\n\n•\tDavidson Institute list of gifted summer programs, sorted by topics of interest:  https://www.davidsongifted.org/gifted-blog/gifted-summer-programs-listed-by-topics-of-interest/\n\n#A Final Test\n\nOne final way to evaluate whether a program is high quality and \"worth it\" or not is to swap out the brand affiliation.  Pretend the program is being offered by a less prestigious college, e.g. a directional state school, rather than a T20.  If Middle Tennessee State offered you a pre-college summer program for $15K, would that look as alluring as the exact same program offered by an Ivy?  Highly selective admissions offices **will not** consider where a program was held or what affiliations/brands it has.  They're evaluating these on the basis of what the actual experience is like and what they can learn about YOU, the applicant, from your experience.  Two great examples of this - among the very best and most impactful summer programs you can do are the Anson Clark Scholars Program and the Simons Summer Research Program, which are held at Texas Tech and Stony Brook.  Those are great colleges, but not especially prestigious.  But it wouldn't matter whether those programs were held at Harvard or your local community college because they fully meet all the criteria I listed above.  By the same token, a go-through-the-motions paygram at a T20 won't hold much weight no matter where it's held or who is sponsoring it because it fails all or nearly all of the criteria.\n\n#TL;DR\n\nMost pre-college summer programs aren't very valuable for college admissions, despite their prestigious locations or high price tags.  Check out my criteria and list of quality programs to make the most of your time and money. \n\nIf you think I missed something, got something wrong, or just have questions, feel free to let me know in the comments or reach out on my website at www.bettercollegeapps.com.  Stay tuned for my next post on how to craft a strong application for truly selective summer programs."

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to offer some encouragement for those taking the MCAT for the first time or who are where I was two years ago - having to face the challenge of preparing for a retake.\n\nI had a goal score of 516, but my first MCAT landed at 500. This was after studying for 7 months through the Altius prep course and averaging 511 on practice exams. When I took the MCAT a second time around 6 months later, I scored a 509.\n\nLet me be clear. a 500 is NOT a bad score, a 509 is NOT a bad score, despite what many on this forum may say. This exam is challenging; this process is hard, don't listen to what some might say, and be easy on yourself. Anyway, despite scoring below my goal and being what many would consider \"not competitive,\" I just received an acceptance from a top 25 MD school a couple of weeks ago!\n\nThe MCAT is just one piece of the puzzle. If your score isn't where you want it to be, that's not the end of the world. Look to compensate in other parts of your application. Make sure you have meaningful experiences - whether clinical, volunteering, or research - that you can genuinely speak about with passion.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to get involved in things unrelated to medicine and science. Join a club in the arts, get into activism, pursue other interests. The best advice I got during undergrad came from my O-chem professor when I asked about adding a chemistry minor to my biopsychology major. He said, \"Don't do that just for medical school. If you're passionate about chemistry, then sure, but med schools get plenty of science geeks. If you're trying to stand out, take some humanities or art classes. It might not directly apply to medicine, but you'll bring a different perspective than other applicants.\"\n\nI didn't cure cancer, I don't even have published research, but I did explore opportunities to expand my understanding of others in various different fields.\n\nBottom line: The MCAT is important but it's not everything. If you can't score in the top 10%, that's okay - 90% of other applicants couldn't either. Focus on what makes you unique and look for other opportunities to make yourself stand out.\n\nYou've got this!\n\n(If anyone would like to ask me questions on my extra curriculars or anything just message me!)"

    "body": "Hello!!!\n\nUPDATE AS OF 11:33pm JUNE 6th 2025: The graduation evaluations department disregarded my initial message and told me to speak to my advisor to fully understand my academic catalog. I responded more firmly about my situation. Explaining that my ACR goes beyond the minimum credit requirements for the school in general and fully meets the requirements for a psychology major completion. While also informing them that I’ve already spoken to two advisors who ensured me that the course I’m “missing” would be waived. The evaluations department have apparently began an investigation to my matters \n\nFINAL UPDATE AS OF 2:36 PM JUNE 20th 2025: The graduation evaluation department has concluded their investigation and approved my application 🥳 Got my diploma!!!! \n\nEnd of Updates\n\n\n——————So I’m very heated and upset right now haha! So figured why not cool off by asking for some advice on here! So here’s my issue :)\n\nI was meant to be a May 2025 graduate ((this is my second bachelors))! During the end of Fall 2024 I met up with my main advisor to discuss how close I was to graduating. My advisor let me know I only needed to take a few more courses left and I had a question regarding a 3 credit hour class((because I’ve never heard about it before and needed clarifications))\n\nShe made it known to me that I would not need to take a class for this 3 credit hour course because it would be waived automatically due to being a Psychology major. What class you may ask? Improving Human Relationships 🙃 so I was excited to see that I was just at the finish line and wrapped up the remaining requirements. By the end of the journey I finished with straight As and even excelling in 6 accelerated courses! \n\nLife was HELL. Suffered a concussion that left me with slowed speech, fuzzy thoughts, and trouble recollecting memories yet still continued going to school and finishing with an A. Even struggled a lot with my mental health and trying to keep up with tuition costs which I made very clear was far too expensive for me and that I needed a monthly payment plan to keep up. The school already fucked up by not fully transferring my general psychology credit from my previous school. So I had to literally ask the department head to grant me access to every class I enrolled for the entirety of my academic journey there! \n\nAll for two advisors to tell me I was fit to graduate and that the missing 3 credit hours were to be waived ((face to face meetings)) and the chairwoman to tell me the same!!!\n\nYou wouldn’t believe my sheer anger to receiving a denial for my graduation now!!! What would my best course of action be? I already sent out an email explaining that I was told this credit would be waived and that I am fit for graduation but with how awful this school has been…. I’m not too sure….\n\nLiterally threatened to send me to collections unless I made a contract with the school too!!! ((I ALREADY HAD A SIGNED CONTRACT WITH THEM AND NEVER MISSED A PAYMENT LMFAO!!! SO THEY ARE THAT HORRIBLE))"

    "body": "So recently i had my stanford interview, the first that I have for this admission cycle and honestly I was very confused.\n\nOk so to preface, I'm applying as a psychology major to become a clinical psychologist and my interviewer was the most STEM person ever. i stalked his LinkedIn I don't understand what he does but I think he's like this stanford MBA guy data science IT guy who made this app for businesses that's kinda popular in my country (he asked if I wanted an IT internship like 20 mins into the interview........ uhm yeah. i know nothing about computers).\n\nBasically he asked me to tell him more about myself and I said the usual, what I wanna study, what I like doing, my hobbies, the things I did in high school that I particularly enjoy, my pscyh research competitions which was a big part of my application, my mental health themed art and how sharing them gave me a sense of impact, etc2 stuff like that and then bro proceeded to say that he knows nothing about what clinical psychology is which okay fine that's okay LOL.\n\nThen he asked what made me different from other applicants. I answer about how I will care more about helping others above my education and that my education would be futile without helping others and that's what makes me so deeply passionate about the career path I chose because I grew up being exposed to so much mental illness from myself, to my friends, to my family and that's why I was interested in learning about the biological factors of mental illnesses. I talked about how a lot of people who applying to stanford probably did a lot of research projects like I did but I talked about how the many psychology research projects for comps that I did was directly tied with what the people around me went through (idk if this is a shit answer but it was what I thought about at the moment) and then BOOOM.......... crickets........... Uhm yeah....... bye. okay sure I just accepted maybe I gave a shitty answer or maybe he just doesn't understand how much psychology means to me and my sense of purpose.\n\nThen he asked why stanford so I gave him my answer about yeah stanford's extensive psychology courses, the labs, how the labs they have are very specific to the psych area I wanna research and he............... doesn't understands, I also talked about community, location, etc2 I just said everything I have in my mind. and he asked deeper WHY STANFORD. and at that point I ran out of answers bcs I alrd told him everything I prepared. and then he debated with me saying that stanford probably isn't the best place to study clinical psychology and that there are other unis out there who are better. He asked me what my fav psychologist was I answered and he googled her and was like \"oh she got her bachelors at Cambridge so surely Cambridge must be the better place to learn clinical psychology\" (he was wrong btw she went to notredame)  ????? i told him that stanford has literally be ranked number one for psychology by a lot of metrics and I avoided this at first bcs I didn't want it to seem like I was only applying to stanford for prestige. Then he went on like 20 minutes backtracking my statements and we had a whole debate about higher education. He told me that stanford only accepts the most impressive of the impressive to which I agreed but then I mentioned about how employers will surely see the rankings of the unis of the ppl they are hiring to which he said no because you can go to a lower ranked school but still be impressive but then I told him that if you were really really outstandingly impressive then you're definitely probably someone who goes to a top tier school. at this point I got tired bcs it felt like he kept on debating everything I said.\n\nThen he told me about how like students who are impressive probably would have already learned everything that they wanna learn before going to stanford and how the internet allows people to do that and how easy it is to get resources for things. (I told him abt reddit and how a lot of my uni research came from reddit). at this point I was thinking like \"ok then what the heck does this guy want me to answer bcs apparently I'm supposed to already know everything that I'm supposed to know and whatever I respond to why stanford will never be enough\" Then he like glazed this girl he like interviewed previously about how like she did a NASA internship online...... (I did my research and my country isn't even listed in the list of countries that NASA accepts for international internships.... so.. uhm......... yeah ok. she probably was a US citizen but living in my country or she had like 10389283 connections) and called her impressive (she is I cant lie). but then  when I told him about my paintings and how I garnered hundreds of thousands of views for my videos sharing my mental health paintings...... boom.. crickets.... and he asked if i thought that \"they were a lot of views\" I said yeah bcs I got hundreds of comments of people saying they resonated with my art and it meant a lot to me bcs I was able to help make an impact to others and make them feel understood.. and then boom..... crickets........... then he debated with me about impact and shit like that and I was just like ok.\n\nSometime during the interview too he like promoted about how good stanford is for startups and talked about a guy who called with him years after their stanford interview to ask for internships.\n\nso in conclusion. Idk how to feel about this interview. Im just a little confused and maybe js thought my answers were shit that's why he felt prompted to debate with me abt most of things I said LOL. its ok though.\n\nTDLR; I'm too emotionally attuned, artsy, social science lover to connect with my techy \"I'm one of the best in my field\" MBA stanford grad interviewer."

I was distraught and frankly, felt like I was a failure for having to reapply the following cycle (side note: you are NOT a failure for reapplying). I was in an inconsolable place, but found some solace after reading u/pumpkpie_chem's love letter reddit post. My hope is to also encourage other fellow reapplicants out there that the journey doesn't end, and it will be okay in the end. (I'm writing this on a whim, so hopefully it's not too disorganized.)\n\nLast cycle, I was on my third gap year and felt that I had done everything in my power to prepare for a strong application. Some more info: ORM, 510-515 MCAT, 3.7 GPA, 4th Q Casper (low preview like 3?), some service-heavy activities, 3000 hrs of research, and longitudinal experiences (you can message me for more details). I applied to almost 50 MD schools (latest complete mid Aug), and threw a few DO in as well, albeit I applied 'late' for DO (complete mid/late Oct). I had done some prior research on making a balanced school list using MSAR, had collected various LORs from my mentors/professors who I felt close with, and delved deep into crafting a PS that I felt was representative of me. Looking back, I did try to have a quick turnaround for secondaries, but ended up submitting many 3-4 weeks afterwards and even later than that due to a family vacation that was veryyy ill-timed. In the end, I received 2 II's: one from my in-state flagship in early September, and another top 20 CA school in December. I was ecstatic for them, but the latter ended in a WL with low hopes of getting off (iykyk which school), and the former a formal R, after being ghosted for 8 months... Each passing day in May felt like torment to me—refreshing SDN every hour, contemplating what further I could do to possibly get off the WL, and basically spiraling. For those who are on WLs, I'm sure you can relate. The unknown felt terrifying.\n\nIn the end, I realized I had to cut my losses for that WL (I'm all or nothing, and it was wiser to redirect my emotional energy fretting into crafting a better reapplication). I decided to go all in to reapply one last time, since AMCAS was open to submit soon. I would say I like to plan for worst-case scenarios... So earlier that February, I had already decided to transition out of my MA role into clinical research, just in case I needed to reapply (you don't have to change roles, but medical schools do generally like to see applicant growth and I felt this was the right choice for me). I did some serious reflection in therapy to address WHY I felt this upset over reapplying, sought advice online, as well as considered whether my application had any unknown red flags that I hadn't considered. I realized that I felt deep shame for having to reapply, because I felt I was \"behind\" some unspoken timeline and failed myself/others. I'd already pushed back my gap years from 1 > 2 due to COVID and health issues, 2 > 3 due to MCAT struggles, and now it would've been 4 gap years (2 planned, and 2 unplanned). I felt even worse when I considered that my classmates from my alma mater (tier 1 school) all seemed to have successful cycles, and many were already even graduating soon! I wanted to crawl into my own shell when I realized I ALSO had to ask my professors to update my LOR, and that I'd have to explain that I'm reapplying. Tbh, that realization felt the worse for me, because I felt that I'd let my mentors down as well.\n\nEventually, I got over the self-pity and decided that I could only move forward; perhaps this would be a redirection for me. I attended some applicant feedback sessions (from my state school), which was helpful in confirming that I didn't have any red flags, but that I probably just didn't \"stand out\" enough. I was VERY torn whether I needed to make major changes to my reapplication since I'd heard that as standard advice, but I'm also very glad I trusted my gut. I made minimal changes to my reapplication, because I believed that it was a matter of FRAMING and presenting myself, and not about the content of my activities or stats. At the core, my \"why medicine\" hadn't changed and I felt it disingenuous to myself to *completely* revamp my application.\n\nSo this cycle, I only changed my healthcare job and my essays (I also applied to 5-10 more schools than last cycle). I worked extremely hard to re-package myself in a way that I felt showed growth, as well as sincere passion and commitment for EACH medical school. These two efforts made a HUGE difference imo. Off the bat, I received 5 MD II's (a couple low tier, one mid-tier, and the others T30) and 4 DO's, with A's to both (though 4/5 of my MD ones ended in WLs, which I withdrew from). I am very grateful that the A I received is actually really close to home for me. When I was younger (not that I'm old), I really wanted to spread my wings far and live further away from family (I did this is undergrad and it wasn't what I imagined lol). But as I've grown, I realized that it's ideal for me personally to be near a support system. Here are some takeaways I've learned as a reapplicant (please take it with a grain of salt, as it's n=1 sample size):\n\n1. MISSION FIT MATTERS. I realized too late that schools genuinely really care to select for the applicant they feel is the \"right fit\" for them. They're usually split between \"research heavy\" and \"service heavy\" schools. My first cycle (2023-24), I had thought I could have my cake and eat it too (I had what I believed to be a lot of research and service), so I didn't intentionally try to cater to either. I tried to market myself as well rounded, and in the end appeared lackluster (well-rounded is good, but be careful with overly appealing to every school). This cycle, I reflected more deeply what my strengths were, and focused on schools that were service-oriented as they aligned more with my values and person. I made it extremely clear in my writing my goals/vision to continue service-related work as a med student and future physician.\n2. ESSAYS are so under-rated. People like to say that you can't have a truly bad or good essay, and the majority are just okay. While that may be true, please don't discredit them. Do NOT plug and chug a template into chatGPT or deepseek and copy-paste into each secondary. I know applying to a broad school list makes it daunting to write everything uniquely, but it will help if you seriously take the TIME to do research about each school, present genuine reasons for WHY you truly like x school, and write from your heart. I was guilty of trying to speedrun essays in my first cycle, and I think that truly hurt my application.\n   1. Schools can tell when you do not care for their mission or unique offerings, and it's more obvious than you'd expect to be able to tell from an applicant's writing tone if they've done their due diligence or not. Some things I did differently included signing up for info sessions and attending them (schools often go into way more detail about their curriculum and mission etc during these), interacting/asking Q's with current students, attending any events from their social media posts, etc. These can help you be more genuine/specific about what specifically you're excited about for x school. Let's be real, many schools have an integrated or flipped classroom curriculum, with distinction tracks, and study abroad programs... As an applicant, you can definitely dig even deeper to find something that resonates with you for why you're PERSONALLY excited to attend x school.\n   2. Additionally, I used flowery language my first cycle. Please don't do that unless you think you can do it well; I imagine adcoms after reading their 10,000th essay would be exhausted from the same overly-sycophantic style of writing. I decided to write sincerely and more straightforward this cycle. I tried to be more clear with my writing and I think it helped greatly (idk if this applies to others, but I do know I struggle with being roundabout).\n3. Craft a good school list (make sure to have more target schools than reaches). There are many resources out there to help with that. An applicant pitfall is applying to too many schools that have low-yield (ex. Georgetown, Drexel), in-state heavy preference (ex. many state schools heavily prefer in state people, most notorious is UW since they usually require WWAMI), service heavy schools without the hours to back it up (ex. Rush, Loyola), or just having too many top tier schools (ex. HYP). I found MSAR to be helpful in seeing the ratio of OOS:IS, applicant and matriculant GPA and MCAT ranges. Be careful applying to too many that your stats are in the lowest or out-of-range percentile (ofc you can apply, but be wary that there's a reason schools have a range and most successful matriculants generally do fall within that range). Additionally, there are a few Jesuit schools (Georgetown, Loyola, SLU, Creighton), so be aware that they often focus on person-centered care/cura personalis. \n   1. I've noticed that many schools tout they're open to OOS, but be wary that more often than not, many schools do genuinely care more for applicants who have local ties or are connected somehow to them. For ex, I believe partly why I received a good midwest MD II was I had some minimal ties to the area. At the end of the day, med schools like to retain their med graduates in the area, so there's reason for them to filter applicants partially based on their likelihood to stay and serve the locale.\n4. PS: I didn't change much for my personal statement this time around, because I believed that my core reason for pursuing medicine hadn't changed. I had already gone through 4-5 iterations of edits last cycle, so I only made minimal edits this reapplication cycle (like 1-2 sentences changed). This may not be true for everyone, so I encourage reapplicants to dig deeper for possible ways to improve! I just wanted to give an example to others that every situation is different.\n5. LORs can be slightly dated. I actually attempted to reach out to all my advisors and was ghosted by my undergrad PI (of 3.5 years) as well as my attending... It was very awkward and I was extremely worried that having a 1-2 year old LOR would hurt my chances. I submitted anyway (with some updated LORs and a couple old ones), and it seems to have went okay! I think realistically, every applicant will have some strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay not to be neurotic over making everything \"perfect.\"\n6. Be wary of \"new\" vs. old reapplied schools! I know people before me have had great luck with reapplying to the SAME schools they did their first cycle as schools often welcome reapplicants. However, I was worried so this time around, I was careful to split about 50/50 with my school list (half old schools, half new schools) in case I would somehow be \"penalized\" for reapplying. Actually, I'm really glad I did this because that old adage has not been the case for me sadly... Most of my II's were actually from \"new\" ones that I hadn't applied to previously. Only one low tier MD interviewed me this cycle that I'd applied to last year. The school I'm attending was a new one I added last minute lol. Additionally, I believe that some schools interview applicants on the cusp sometimes with minimal/no intention of giving them an A, barring extreme circumstances. This is only my opinion, but I interviewed at a few top 20 schools with lower stats as an ORM, and was placed on all WLs. I think schools may give you a chance based on your life story or mission fit, but do be careful overextending hope on getting off certain WLs (like be cautiously hopeful). \n\n7. Make sure your story is cohesive. It should make sense to adcoms how one activity/life event has led you to another, and ultimately to medicine. Your AMCAS activities, PS, and secondaries should clarify WHY medicine, but also prove to adcoms that you are certain this path is for you. They want to know you've done your due diligence to ascertain what this path entails (as it's long, often gruelsome work, and is a heavy investment), as well as ensure you are ready for the rigors of school and standardized testing. Your job as an applicant is to somehow prove/show them that you know what you're getting yourself into.\n8. IIs. Usually they're MMI or traditional. Interestingly, in my last cycle, my two IIs were MMI-based. And during my post-interview feedback, the director of admissions noted that ONE of my stations didn't quite like my answer for MMI :( I was surprised since the common saying is that interviewers just want to hear your reasoning and there's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer. After interviewing 10+ schools cumulatively, I will say that I've noticed that while that can be true, interviewers are still human and they may resonate more or less with certain answers you have.. I previously read the MMI book by Desai and it was helpful for me, however I can't say much about it since this cycle, my As were all from traditional interviews lol... It's possible that I just really suck at MMI or it's a fluke, but regardless, I highly encourage (re)applicants to be cautious about how you portray your answers and I think practice for MMI can help. I think as a non-trad, my strength was traditional interviews since I'd already worked various jobs prior and am very familiar with how to do well in it. For traditional interviews, be human; it's okay to make jokes or even be awkward! Adcoms know it's stressful so there's no need to overly rehearse your answers (be sure to know why med, why doctor, tell me about yourself, why this school).\n\nI'm sure there's more stuff but these are all I can think of now. If this can help one person, I will feel it was more than worth! Again, these are my own thoughts so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nI sometimes get bummed that it took me more years than my peers (which is more of a me issue that I want to address in therapy lol), however I do truly believe that things fall into place for a reason. If I had gotten in last cycle, I would've been ill-prepared because I was recovering from an intensive surgery and couldn't physically move/be a student. I've recovered since then and feel I've come a long way in this last year (I'm grateful for the added year I had to spend with family and friends as well, and explore my early to mid 20s). Have faith in yourself, and know that it's not over until it's truly over. As one mentor once said to me, \"it's a long becoming process.\" \n\nMy DM's are open and I'll try my best to answer any questions :) Good luck future applicants and reapplicants! I believe you can do this <3 "

    "body": "Hello Second Semester Seniors!\n\nI'm seeing lots of posts about what to do this semester and how to stay motivated while worrying about the state of the world, your admissions decisions, and being rescinded (post on that coming next week). If you’re feeling a little bit of senioritis, please know the struggle is real. And if you’re feeling even more worried about your college applications now than you were before you submitted them, you are not alone! Letting go of control is no easy task. You know that life can feel like it’s falling apart and that you will survive it. You know that we need a little wind in our lives to make us stronger. You know, that just like those baby trees in the biosphere that fell down when they didn’t have anything pushing on them -- we need some stress in our lives. If you aren’t familiar with my take on the trees in the biosphere, you can read more about it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1hdging/college_admissions_decisions_wind_and_why_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nBut let’s be real -- there’s stress, and then there’s stress. So, I want you to be especially careful with yourselves now. And please know that even if you feel like you are all alone in this college admissions journey, you don’t have to remain distant from the world. We can be alone in all this together.\n\n# Before I move on to the Cures for Senioritis, I want to share a few Second Semester Senior Housekeeping Tips:\n\n* PORTALS: Check your portals regularly (not obsessively) to make sure everything is turned in.\n* ENGAGE WITH COLLEGES: If the colleges consider interest, stay engaged -- surf their website, read emails and click links, and check out their social media pages (you can find out if colleges consider Demonstrated Interest or engagement on the Common Data Set (google “common data set and school name.”\n* LOCI: Write your LOCI if you were deferred. [Here’s a link to my How to Write a LOCI.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1hzv51q/if_you_were_deferred_its_time_to_think_about_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* INTERVIEWS: Check your email and voice mails for interview arrangements. [Here's a link to my Step by Step Interview Guide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1gncymk/admissionsmoms_2024_stepbystep_guide_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* UPDATES: Consider sending an update if you have something important to share that’s changed since you last applied (major awards, accomplishments, test scores, improved grades from mid-semester, etc)\n* COLLEGE LIST: If you’re not completely comfortable with your college list and feel like you need to flesh it out a little more or add some Sure Bet Schools -- see my [recent post with some of my favorite colleges with deadlines of Feb 1 or later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1i3n6x4/hey_seniors_if_youre_not_happy_with_your_college/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n# CURING SENIORITIS\n\nI mean I wish I could say “take two aspirin and call me in the morning,” but it’s not quite that simple. It does require you to engage and take some action -- some investing in yourself (more on that later…)\n\n* TAKE A BREAK: First, it’s okay to give yourselves a break. Stop what you’re doing and just be still. Don’t worry about any kind of position or what to focus on. Just set your phone timer for any amount of time that feels right for you, turn off your notifications, and do nothing. Your brain needs a break at times. It’s been going full-on probably since always, so let those brain batteries recharge. I promise it helps.\n* EMBRACE THE NOT-KNOWING: We NEVER know what’s going to happen in life, and often, no matter how we plan, how we think we know where we’re headed, we end up going a different route that we might not have chosen or even known about, and we wouldn’t want it any other way. You have no idea what the decisions colleges will make about your application, and it’s scary, but embrace that feeling of not-knowing. Gather it around you and do brave things, knowing that no matter what decision any college makes, YOU are gonna be just fine.\n* BEING RESCINDED IS A REAL THING: It’s not that common, but you need to be mindful. I’ll be making a post here on A2C about the perils and realities of being rescinded in the next couple of weeks, [but you can check out my substack post from last year](https://admissionsmom.substack.com/p/what-you-really-need-to-know-about?r=3qhdg3) now if you’re worried. \n* KEEP UP YOUR GRADES: Don’t let your grades drop below a grade level or two, and don’t let it happen in more than a class or two.\n* DON'T GO CRAZY ON SOCIAL MEDIA: Don't make obnoxious posts, no matter how frustrated you are or how edgy you want to be. Being rescinded for social media posts, whether posted by you or someone who recorded you, is very real. I’m going to share a post about being rescinded next week sometime, but just keep plugging away in your classes and put kindness first in your life -- it’s needed now more than ever. Put kindness first in your life -- it’s needed now more than ever.\n* LET COLLEGES KNOW IF YOUR LIFE IS GETTING MESSY: If circumstances in your life are creating difficulties with your classes and your grades are falling, be open with admissions offices, especially if you are caring for sick family members, you have limited access to technology or the internet, you have had to take on more job or family responsibilities because of the economic crisis, or you’ve been sick yourself. Colleges want to know about these kinds of circumstances, and if you didn’t use the additional info section to discuss your situation or your circumstances have changed because of the craziness of the world we live in (or just because life is hard sometimes), send them an update. You can find out more about how to write this update by reading this [post about Supplemental Essays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xdbil5/making_your_peace_with_the_supplemental_essays/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Scroll to the Additional Info section.\n* MAKE YOUR BED AND CLEAN YOUR ROOM: When we are feeling overwhelmed by life, it can be easy to let things go -- but keeping up with the space around you and finding some physical and mental space to breathe can be important. Make your bed first thing in the morning. Clean up all that garbage on your floor. Gather your clothes and toss them in the laundry basket. Take all your dirty dishes to the kitchen and put them in the dishwasher. Wipe up sticky surfaces.\n* CONNECT WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS: Now is the prime time for you to start those game nights and family dinner nights. Maybe hang out with siblings that you haven’t had time for before.\n* LEARN SOMETHING NEW: Maybe pick up a new hobby. Have you ever wanted to learn Italian or coding? Or how to play guitar? Now’s your chance. If you haven’t yet delved into yoga, meditation, and mindfulness, understanding your mind-body connection will help you as you move forward into college.\n* READ BOOKS: Maybe you’ve never had time to read all those books you hear about and want to try. Pick a few that interest you and get going. I love listening to books while I walk. Reading and having fiction be part of your life builds your ability to process and gain empathy for others and encourages your creativity. Here are three suggestions of books I’ve loved in the last year: *The Midnight Library* (I believe this book should be required reading for students applying to college), *Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow*, *Project Hail Mary*\n* COLLECT MOMENTS OF JOY: It’s easy for us to get wrapped up in all the bad and stressful stuff of our lives, and for sure, there’s some stressful stuff happening right now, but there’s still some good. Collect those small moments of joy in your life and you’ll see that they can add up. Maybe it’s new snow on the ground, or a brilliant blue sky like I can look up and see in Houston right now. Maybe it’s a quick snuggle with your dog or cat or a giggle with a sibling or a friend. Maybe it’s a smile you give someone else. Maybe it’s a funny post you saw on r/ApplyingToCollege or Instagram or a line in a book you just read. Even if you feel like your life just sucks right now because of all the shit that’s happening around you and school and college admissions and… and… and…, there are moments of joy. Collect them.\n* QUICK TIPS FOR WHEN YOU JUST DON’T WANT TO MOVE:\n   * Take a cold shower\n   * Blast Music and Dance\n   * Sing\n   * Bake Something\n   * Drink a glass of COLD water\n   * Put on scented lotion\n   * Go for a walk around the block\n\n# Think of this Semester as a Gift\n\nYou will never get back this time in high school, and you’ll never get back this time at home with your family. This is a time for you to sit back, reflect on your life, what you’ve done, and where you want to go, and most importantly, what is happening to you right now.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot lately about how I spend my time and how I invest my time, and what the difference is. I need to do a little of both, for sure, but I want to invest my time in learning and growing as a person, in building relationships with those around me, and creating space for myself to experience life in ways I might not yet have been able to. That means I’m trying to invest my time in reading, walking, and hopefully learning to do new things and about new ideas. The gift of second-semester senior year allows many of you an opportunity to sit back and think about how you want to invest your time. Still, sometimes the best way I can invest my time is investing in doing nothing, or NetFlix (my new favorite show is Daybreak from 2019 -- highly highly suggest!), Hulu, or YouTube binging, or just hanging out with friends. To me, the biggest difference is spending even that kind of relaxed, doing-nothing time intentionally.\n\n# If you find yourself overwhelmed in the moment (and we all do sometimes)\n\nHere’s a little trick I like to do -- maybe give it a try yourself: Ground yourself in the present moment by listing 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can feel, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.\n\n\n\n# Tl;dr:\n\nSenioritis is totally normal; you are not alone. Senioritis happening among political unrest and unprecedented universal anxiety -- definitely nothing normal about that, but your feelings are. The cure? Take time to recharge batteries, keep up your grades, be nice to others, try something new, connect with yourself, and breathe.\n\nAlso, check out [Let’s Talk about Senioritis](https://youtu.be/h9nyPWfwhik) on YouTube from a couple of years ago. I chatted with a couple of students who were seniors last year about dealing with senioritis, and all things second-semester seniors.\n\nXOXOXO AdmissionsMom"

    "body": "*tldr: I transferred from davis to san diego as a bio major and realized it didn't really matter in the end*  \n––––––––––––––––\n\nHello hello A2C– I'll be honest I was never really an active member of A2C, and never identified with the people shotgunning to like 25+ plus schools, but I would always lurk on this subreddit in my senior year of high school.\n\nLong story short, I thought I worked pretty hard in high school (had a 3.88 uw gpa, marching band for 4 years, 10 APs, decent PIQs, involvement in a few other extracurriculars, oh also east asian female from a highly competitive school district), but nothing too special–  I did have high hopes for UCI/UCSD, and was crushed when UCSD waitlisted me and eventually rejected me. Needless to say I was pretty disheartened when my only viable options were UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara. (I visited SB TWICE, thinking that maybe it would grow on me the second time around but u bet my ass the day parties did not help my impression) (I say disheartened but I actually sunk into a depressive state for a good two months lol– not a good time)\n\nI ended up going to UC Davis for my first year, and while I was actively dreading and resisting going there in the first few months, the campus and its quaint college town grew on me over time. I had the quintessential college freshman experience (arguably better than it would've been at SD, imo), experienced dorm drama and the all too canon freshman friendgroup event, and made some really good friends I actively keep in touch with and visit! I chose Davis at the time as it had a better biosci program (and still is one of the BEST UCs for anything bio/ag/animal sci or prehealth), and its small town environment and friendly student body resonated with me more.\n\nHowever, November rolled around, and I still felt myself wanting for more, and dissatisfied with how my college decisions turned out. I feel that I very much internalized the culture of my high school/a2c/high achieving peers, but that's another conversation. I would come to realize that the school I went to really didn't define my worth, and that your major and career direction is arguably a lot more important. But at that time it consumed my whole world, and it was really important to me to prove to myself that I deserved better, and that I wasn't complacent in where I ended up.\n\nSo I began embarking on the journey of writing my PIQs and starting the transfer application for the second year in a row. There are such limited resources for navigating the UC-to-UC transfer process, and I was adamant about not contacting my advisors for some reason, so it was really just a combination of scouring reddit + quora + sheer hope lol. Just four days before the deadline, I wrote all my essays, and turned in my final application with seconds to spare the night before.\n\nAfter I turned my application in, I honestly stopped thinking about it as much– I doubted I would even qualify as a transfer student since I'd only been in college for two months at that point, didn't have my letter of reciprocity, and just barely had enough credits for junior standing. I told myself I would accept whatever decision came my way, and was already preparing for ways I would get more involved in my second year.\n\nCome mid april, I received my decisions letters from UCLA, Berkeley and UCSD, the three schools I decided to reapply to. I got waitlisted at Berkeley, accepted at SD (where I am now!!), and rejected from LA lol not like i wanted to go to la anw lol (cope). I genuinely wasn't expecting anything because again, I didn't meet transfer requirements, and didn't have all my GEs but it was such a pleasant surprise and so validating after working nonstop for almost a year.\n\n––––––––––––––––\n\nI'm writing this post as a success story, but honestly transferring to UCSD didn't solve most of my problems– if anything it made it harder to focus on my classes and what I wanted to get out of college as I had to reestablish my social circle and adjust to the campus all over again. It does allow me to be closer to home and visit family more often, but whatever they say about \"wherever you go, there you are\" is too real. I honestly regretted my decision to transfer at certain points, and found myself missing the laid back environment of Davis (all my homies hate ecobrutalist architecture), but I attribute a lot of that to the built environment (UCSD is great at separating people with their eight colleges) and not working on myself.\n\nCollege is a lot of things, sometimes the least of which the actual school you go to. The college experience of sitting in a 400 person lecture hall, living with a bunch of other clueless 18 year olds, cramming for your exams last minute, going to your first frat party, attending sporting events, caring for your drunk roommate  and most importantly growing and learning who you are, **are all things that can be experienced at any college**. And just getting into any UC qualifies you to be a member of some of the most prestigious and rigorous research institutions in the country! So while it's completely valid to be crushed by your college decisions, and mope around aimlessly for however long you need, **please know that your worth is not in any way defined by the college you go to**. Your peers might tell you otherwise, your parents may try to convince you you're a failure, your sense of self worth might tank but I PROMISE YOU you are so much more than a stupid college decision. I've met such insanely hardworking and intelligent transfer students at SD who've transferred from cc, merced, santa cruz, and more, and even if you don't choose to transfer, please pleaseplease don't let that define you. I promise there is a place for you at those schools, even if it does take time. There are more important things to worry about (namely what the fuck should I pursue a career in because this economy is getting royally fucked lol lol) but I digress.\n\nFeel free to dm me if you have any questions about the transfer process, my experience at davis/sd and comparisons between the two, or need support to get through the tough time that is college decision season. Also it might take awhile for me to respond bc it is in fact finals season and I am actively procrastinating on studying for three exams LMAOOOO ok goodbye."

    "body": "Hello r/gradadmissions,\n\nI'm a first-generation international applicant who recently completed a long graduate school application season and I’d like to share my experience. I applied to Master’s programs in Computer Science and some closely related fields. These kinds of posts helped me a lot when I was applying, so I hope this can offer a bit of insight (or at least some encouragement) to someone out there.\n\n*Note: This post roughly follows the structure commonly used in* r/collegeresults. *If you’re mainly interested in the outcomes - or if you come from a similar background - feel free to skip ahead to sections 5 (Admission Results) and 6 (Reflection)*.\n\n# 1. Background Information\n\n**Gender:** Male  \n**Nationality:** German  \n**Residence:** Small town in Baden-Württemberg \n**Personal Background:** No elite academic environment, no family ties to university, but a strong record of extracurriculars and academic development over time.\n\n**Education Path:** Hauptschule - Realschule - Gymnasium - Bachelor’s degree\n\n→ For those unfamiliar with the German school system: this path is quite unusual. I started in the lowest secondary education track (*Hauptschule*). Both *Hauptschule* and *Realschule* don’t qualify students for university. *Hauptschule*, in particular, carries a strong social stigma and is often associated with low academic expectations. Eventually, advancing to *Gymnasium* and earning the *Abitur* made me eligible for university.\n\n# 2. Academic Record\n\n**Undergraduate Institution:** Non-target university in Germany, but strong STEM curriculum  \n**Major:** Information Systems  \n**Minor:** Computer Science  \n**GPA:** 1.1 / 1.0 (German scale, with 1.0 being best); 3.93 / 4.00 (evaluated by an American evaluation service)  \n**Academic Honors:** Scholarship from one of Germany’s most respected foundations.\n\n**Research Experience:**\n\n* 4 months of nationally funded industry research, contributing to a published paper\n* 10 months of ML research (specifically XAI) at my university’s Chair of Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning\n\n**Professional Experience:**\n\n* 6 months internship (Data Science)\n* 6 months internship (Business Analytics)\n\n**GRE / GMAT:** Not required by the programs I applied to, so I didn’t take either.\n\n# 3. Extracurriculars & Community Service\n\nThere’s a lot, and it would take a whole new post, so I’ll just touch on that briefly.\n\nDuring my early school days, I started volunteering in my local church and joined our local sports club’s swimming division. Later, during *Gymnasium* (what one could roughly refer to as high school), I became a semi-professional athlete, eventually coaching young athletes and serving on the board of our local sports club.\n\nAt university, I joined the board of a national student association focused on education and helped shape the German education landscape for students across the country. I also started working as a volunteer programming tutor in my second year.\n\nMidway through my undergraduate studies, I began mentoring underrepresented groups in academia. Given my own background, this has always meant a lot to me personally.\n\n# 4. Statement of Purpose & Personal Statement\n\nThis one’s highly individual, and you should follow the outline you’re most comfortable with. Typically, the application portal will give you some guidance on what to cover in your statement.\n\nIn my case, I followed a structured outline. Depending on the school, I adjusted the focus. While each program required a slightly different perspective, I made sure that my core values and long-term goals came through consistently.\n\nFrom my point of view, there’s no blueprint that guarantees success. However, I’ve found it helpful to focus on a few key elements: personal motivation, academic foundation, relevant experience, and program-specific fit. Frankly, I think the latter is the most critical aspect to work on.\n\n# 5. Admission Results\n\n**Accepted:**\n\n* Brown (final decision)\n* Boston University\n\n**Waitlisted:**\n\n* Cornell Tech\n\n**Rejected:**\n\n* MIT\n* Harvard\n* Columbia\n* NYU\n\n# 6. Reflection\n\nLooking back, I realize that my goal was very ambitious. None of the schools I applied to would be considered a “safety” (at least as far as I’m aware). What mattered to me was how the programs \"felt\" (admittedly hard to put into words) based on the resources available, the way they communicated their values, and the atmosphere during virtual info sessions. With that in mind, these seven universities made it onto my short list.\n\nWhat’s worth mentioning is that this goal (to study at one of these universities) helped pull me out of a depression I had been suffering from for several years. I won’t go into detail here, but one day (still grateful for that moment) I realized that life holds far more possibilities than meets the eye. An article in a local magazine about American universities really piqued my interest. From that point on, I gave everything I had to build a strong academic profile. That was the very beginning of my undergraduate studies.\n\nHonestly, I don’t see myself as particularly brilliant compared to the many talented students around the world. I just worked hard, stayed as consistent as I could, and kept going. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was driven by this goal. Those three and a half years were, in a way, also the duration of my application journey.\n\nFrankly, I’m more than happy to join Brown’s Sc.M. in Computer Science since it was one of my three dream programs from the get go. Back in the day, when I started at *Hauptschule*, I didn’t even consider the idea of attending any university. It felt completely out of reach (at least, that’s what the social stigma suggested). Given my unconventional educational background and various extracurricular activities, the experiences I had have given me a unique perspective on life and learning.\n\nIn essence, I strongly believe that your path isn’t predetermined. It’s something you can shape through action. Search for opportunities to grow, be curious about different aspects of life, surround yourself with like-minded people, enjoy the ride (even when times aren’t that bright), and be grateful. If someone like me managed to achieve a goal like this, I bet you’ll do great once you get started!\n\nThat being said, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate you all! Best of luck with whatever comes next :)"

    "body": "Hello A2C.\n\nIt's Tuesday, the most depressing day of the week, so I thought I'd share a few stories from my college process that, in hindsight, are hilarious. This is also an invitation to drop your own stories, so we're not all laughing at me.\n\n1. **The Emory Tour Guide fell over**  \nFor my second-ever college tour, I visited Emory. Having just come from Vanderbilt, where the tour guides talked at-length about not walking backwards for safety and attention, I was kind of surprised to see a regular backwards-walking tour guide. Then he fell over. He was fine, and super sweet. Some of his friends rushed over to help him up; if anything, this just made the school look better. If very, very hilly.\n\n2. **My Guidance Counselor \"failed\" to talk me out of ED**  \nMy school's guidance department has a bit of an...interesting reputation. They're supposedly very good, and very trustworthy. Last November, I was caught between ED'ing to a super long shot T15 and a slightly less long shot T30, to which my  counselor told me to ED to...neither. I needed to ED to one of my safeties. When her month-long campaign didn't work, she considered it a failure. I got into my ED (the T30), and she now quietly pretends this didn't happen.\n\n3. **My Best Friend thought I'd be too dumb for Cambridge**  \nA bit of a shorter story, but right after getting a Cambridge interview, one of my best friends tried to convince me not to take the interview, and not to go if I got in. I never got a straight answer, until I eventually figured out that I was not considered smart enough. Eh, probably true. I'm definitely not British enough. Proof: I wrote about President Eisenhower for my LNAT essay (Law National Aptitude Test, like the SATs for law in England). Anyway my friend and I are good now, and I'm staying in the USA.\n\n4. **Admission Officer tries to see my Movie**  \nMentioned to an AO at a college fair that I was working on a fantasy short film about college admissions. He was *fascinated*. I'd have sent him a copy, but a year later it's still being edited. I'll be sharing a campus with him, though, so maybe I'll invite him to the screening.\n\n5. **Admissions rep calls out me specifically in a talk**  \nThis is the one that'll tip anyone from my school off to who is writing this, since this is basically just school lore at this point. My HS hasn't send someone to a specific T20 school in about a decade, despite consistently sending to Ivies and other T10s. I really loved the school after my tour, and after researching why this could be, I decided to just ask. I sent an email via the admissions team question box, a short essay basically saying that I loved the school and wanted to know if my HS was officially blacklisted. I passed this by my counselor, who had no major issues with it. I got a response back a few months later, telling me not to ask this kind of thing and saying that they couldn't tell me. I brushed this off. Months later, an Admissions Rep from this school came to my school to give a talk––the same person who'd responded to my email. She talked for a few minutes (7 or so) about how she sometimes gets \"emails\" from people at my school asking *exactly the questions I asked*, and how that was very out of line. I was sitting in the second row.\n\n6. **AO calls my application is called \"Vibrant\"**  \nGenuinely, what does this mean? I think it's a good thing?"

    "body": "Hi, I’m going to try to make this as short as I can without rambling. Currently I’m a 4th year university student. I transferred from a cc and got excepted as a Korean culture and literature major. Now with my graduation around the corner, I’m starting to wonder if I made a mistake and it’s making me feel a bit depressed. \n\n\nOriginally I didn’t plan on going to college, mainly because of my mental health. I was fighting depression and anxiety during my junior and senior years in high school, which demotivated me and kept me from wanted to continue my studies. So I decided to take a break from school. Eventually I started going back to school feeling motivated by my dream to someday go to South Korea. I wanted to go to school doing something I enjoyed and loved instead of focusing only on the money aspect. My plan was to do whatever I can to go to Korea. The best option was for me to work as an English teacher, which only really required I receive my bachelor’s in any subject. So I thought why not Korean studies? I can go to school and study something I’m interested in. And while I still have an interest in Korean culture and language, with my graduation coming up, and with me really being forced to actually face my future I’m getting cold feet.\n\nToday I went out for coffee with a Korean acquaintance, and the conversation we had really made me start to think. She basically told me that most Koreans prefer to have connections with other Koreans. That they for the most part cannot get real close to foreigners and tend to be more closed off. And while I did notice that even in a very heterogeneous place like where I live (I live in California) Koreans do mostly stick together. I had a meetup with my former Korean language professor who is really young, and she said she has no foreign friends and she doesn’t really care to. \nI used to chalk it up to maybe they really wanted to make friends with non Korean people, but they had a difficult time because of the language barrier. I naively thought that they wanted to. According my Korean acquaintance they just don’t really care to. And if they do it’s not a true friendship. And unfortunately even foreigners in Korea said most Koreans refer to them as their “foreign friend” not just a friend. \n\nIt got me thinking about what kind of genuine relationships I can actually make there. Especially for someone like me who is quite shy and a bit sensitive, I can’t help but start to wonder how well I will actually do in Korea. \nIt’s already weighing down on me that I’ll be leaving my family. But it was something I was willing to risk because of my idealism and faith things can go well and I can experience another culture, which was my dream. \n\nI plan to study abroad over the summer in Korea, but now what happens if I go and don’t like it? What kind of job could I actually get in the US with a Korean literature and culture degree? Thanks to my stupid decisions I am limited to my options. \nI’ve thought about postponing graduation and maybe double majoring in maybe journalism, but can I really do that? I don’t even know if my financial aid will cover any of that. And with Trump in office I don’t even know if I will continue to get aid. I just don’t know what my future holds. I’m sitting here thinking my mom was right, I should’ve had a plan b instead of living in my dreamland thinking things will go well. Now it’s hitting me, and I don’t know if I screwed up my academic opportunities, and this might be one of my biggest mistakes yet. Is this really the end? I don’t know what to do at this point. "

    "body": "I applied to colleges in the last admissions cycle. Despite doing extensive research, I decided to get a personal college counselor to *really* improve my application.\n\n**In short, was $7k worth it? Not really.**\n\n# Results\n\nI applied for Mechanical Engineering everywhere.\n\nI applied to the top 4 UCs, all Ivies, and other top schools like Stanford, USC, UMich, etc.  \nIn the end, my best admission offers were UMich, Georgia Tech, and NYU. I ultimately chose Georgia Tech (before someone asks why -- it was the most affordable option).\n\n# My Experience\n\nHonestly, the private counseling helped me a to an extent. Specifically:\n\n* Common App Essay: My counselor helped me improve the \"narrative\" of my essay. Initially, it sounded very book-story-like, with little \"personality\" to it. But my counselor guided me in a direction that definitely improved the essay. This was the biggest help, and it basically ends here lol.\n* Activities: While my counselor suggested specific ways to present my activities, it wasn’t anything extraordinary. After reviewing them, he mostly liked what I already had. Resources like some of the threads here by admissions mom, app helper, scholar grade, etc. were really helpful, and I had already used their advice to write my activities effectively.\n* Supplemental Essays: Same here. I had already read some incredible posts on this sub and guides by [collegeessayguy.com](http://collegeessayguy.com), which helped me a lot. My counselor didn’t make any major changes.\n* Other queries: I had a few random doubts about parts of the Common App, and my counselor did answer them, but most of the answers were what I expected. Did it help me re-confirm things I was unsure about? For sure. But was it worth paying that much for it? Not at all.\n\nOverall, I would say if I had paid like $2k-$3k, then it probably would have been worth it. Common app essay was the biggest help. But for everything else, all free resources and threads here on A2C are already top notch.\n\nThere’s an app called CounselAI on the app store which helped me a bit too, especially with supplemental essays. It has a feature that suggests unique ideas specific to a college based on your background. It’s paid after a free trial, so I only used it for a month. But I think it’s worth it for $20, because the final essay review was pretty similar to what I got from my counselor.\n\n# My Advice\n\nONLY if you can afford to spend some extra money, you should get a private counselor. That is it.\n\nThey aren't useless, nor are they some beings with secret knowledge. The point I'm trying to make is that **A2C is the best counselor for EVERYONE.** If you have 2nd thoughts on getting a counselor, it means you can't afford it, so don't. You just need to put in some extra work and read all the threads, go through college essay guy's blogs, and use tools like notion/the app i mentioned/google docs etc to combine all of these learning together in your application.\n\nI’d like to add that I opted for private counseling during my senior year. I know that some counselors begin working with students as early as their sophomore or junior year, offering additional support such as selecting extracurricular activities or starting essays early. However, these services come with an even higher cost so again it boils down to IF you TRULY have extra money to afford it. Otherwise, everything is online."

My parents are willing to help a little bit on tuition but the majority of it will still be on me with me taking out student loans. My plans after college is 1) getting into quant finance for top firms like Jane Street, Citadel, HRT, 2) deep research so hopefully at companies like OpenAI or Anthropic, 3) Big Tech (Magnificient 7/FAANG), 4) Startup (but this is mainly after a couple years out of college where I'm financially stable). \n\n  \nI'm confused about three things:\n\n1) At Stanford, I know the startup culture is world class (but that is not my main concern right out of college) and the on campus recruiting is insane but I wonder if I can get comparable level of opportunities in both start-ups and company jobs in Berkeley and UCSD as it is far cheaper. Also, for quant I feel like companies may perceive Stanford and Berkeley quite similarily as they are both geographically not ideal but great for STEM.\n\n2) At Berkeley, this seems to be the intermediate of opportunity and cost since it would be sub quarter million in summative cost but still holds extremely high respect in the industry. I'm just worried because I didn't get the REGENT's scholarship and I've heard class priority registrations are brutal. In addition, Berkeley being a public school means that a larger population will be competing for the same opportunities so this is the major concern in mind.\n\n3) At UCSD, the Jacob's scholarship offers not only financial benefits but on campus benefits too. It provides the possibility to do research in my freshmen year of college and possibly networking opportunities. I know it's free but considering the jobs I'm aiming for the reputation of UCSD is not even enough to cut it alone so I need to be certain there will be additional great opportunities to make sure it will be a solid option. \n\n  \nI would appreciate as many perspectives as possible since it has been on me and my parent's minds for days.

I know a lot of people say bad things about northeastern alt campuses as well as just northeastern itself, but a lot of my family has gone there. \n\n\\- I have family who is faculty there as well as family who attend.

I would prefer a city. I also didn't like all the Greek life and had a weird encounter with a frat dude. \n\n\\- It felt like a party school, but I knew that I would really benefit from Kelley especially if I wanted to take the consulting path. I have a friend who attends and said he would help me get opportunities and stuff. Just don't know if I can see myself there.\n\n# Washington: \n\n**-** Visited about 2 years ago, and this is definitely up there for most beautiful campus.\n\n\\- don't know if i can handle the rain that much I'm from a very sunny place. \n\n\\- direct admission to the business school, which has a pretty good reputation. \n\n\\- I think I would enjoy it, don't really feel super good or bad about it\n\n# UNC:\n\n\\- just got off the waitlist 2 days ago \n\n\\- Was super hyped until i realized i wasn't a direct admit\n\n\\- Really like the campus(on youtube) and think i could fit in fs, but I hear that it's super difficult to get into the business school after freshman year + most ppl are instate and have their friend groups\n\n\\- will visit the campus later this month\n\n# Georgia Tech:\n\n\\- got into scheller off waitlist but need to do the first year abroad program... which sounds okay, i guess?(i will spend my first semester in France or oxford)\n\n\\- i have to go to school in july💀\n\n\\- don't think i fit into the Georgia Tech vibes\n\n\\- really liked the campus, and I heard good things about the first year abroad program\n\n\\- don't know if i wanna be away first semester u know??\n\n\n\n**Honestly, I have no idea what to pick I'm leaning so many different ways... please lmk any thoughts u have.

    "body": "Hey all, I thought I would share a bit about my story to make a larger point of college admissions and self worth as things start to pick up this cycle.\n\nI want to talk about my story with college admissions starting from my profile in high school up until now, my junior year in college and make a larger point about how college admissions works and specifically, its flaws.\n\nTo make a long story short, here was my profile coming out of high school:\n\nGPA: 3.8 UW/ 4.1 W\n\nTest Score: None\n\nHigh school: Private, College Prep, Bay Area\n\nExtra curriculars: President model UN club, Dual sport athlete (Did get recruited, but turned all offers down), TA for advanced level computer science course at high school for two years. Self studied two 2 AP's totally on my own, and then some various jobs and volunteer work I did in high school.\n\nAnd so my college results!\n\nI got into some pretty good schools but nothing crazy. I don't want to name names because I don't want to make objective judgements with my subjective experience with my college admissions results but I ended up attending the \"best\" one of them (ya know based on the college ranking websites, what people think was prestigious, etc etc)... and it was really easy. My last semester there I was double majoring and quadruple minoring and I took 13 courses, some of them graduate level. As a result, I ended up transferring to a top end program for my students. So the big question - how could this happened and what does it mean for you?\n\nI think an important place to start with this is that most people I know, do end up going to their correct fit when it comes to college admissions. Almost all people I've kept tabs on from my high school end up saying their college is hard for them and few will transfer. And those that do, it's equal parts social or financial than for academic reasons.\n\nHowever, I think the problem with my application is from a college admissions pov, it's not that great. Think about it, model united nations, athlete but isn't coming through the recruiting pipeline, TA'ing, some random volunteering, jobs, these are all activities that college admissions officers see, yawn, and say \"next\" to. However, these activities are not any less valuable or not any harder than doing some maybe more intriguing things like research or whatever else crazy stuff you guys do to get into college nowadays. The reality is I was not, and still am not, a worse applicant or student than someone who played the game of college admissions better, it was just my work was systemically devalued under the perspective of college admissions officers. So then it's not surprising that someone with my profile was undervalued when it came to getting into college. I was working any harder when I was doing 13 courses at my private college than high school, but all of a sudden, I was suddenly more \"impressive\" when it came to college admissions for being the same person and putting in the same amount of work.\n\nSo that brings me to today. I ended up transferring to a top end public university, quadruple majoring in some top end programs I knew I had no shot of getting into out of high school. I am very happy with where I am because my work now thoroughly does push me to be a better student and challenges me appropriately (and no, my gpa isn't like 2.0 and I have a social life).\n\nSo, what are the key takeaways and what I am trying to say with this post?\n\n1. You are not any less important for what you do.\n\nCollege admissions poses a very toxic mindset of there being right and wrong things to do with your time because some stuff will be more \"valuable\" in the eyes of the admissions officers and some stuff \"cliche.\" But the reality is this way of thinking is really toxic and you should not judge your livelihood based on this perspective. Instead, do what you want to do regardless of what college admissions would think of it as frankly, college admissions is only really a part of your life for 1.5 years (out of all your years alive).\n\n2. College admissions is a very flawed system and it is inevitable some people will \"fall through the cracks\"\n\nI have a great relationship with my middle school admissions officer who said they were experiencing way more applicants in past years then every before. He told me he was trying to make the experience as objective (numeric) as possible but even then it was really hard to make a decision. However, there are going to be people that just don't fit this very narrow way of judging talent and that's college admissions officers fault for having a flawed system, not your fault for being talented and shining in the ways in which you want to.\n\n3. Who you are and your work will be the most important factor at the end of the day\n\nSo we get that college admissions officers have a flawed and specific way of judging talent but is it still important to \"play the game\" and get a great college name for yourself? No, because even if you do get \"robbed\" when it comes to college acceptances your grades and talents will clearly show your profile is fitting of someone that should be in a higher end environment. So to this, don't forget that you can transfer colleges if you are afraid this will be you and as soon as you get out into the real world all that will matter will be where you graduated from - not which colleges you got into out of high school.\n\n4. College admissions are not the be all end all, even if it will sting for a year or two\n\nI get it, I was down the A2C rabbit hole in high school and was devoting my life religiously to working hard and making the best college application as possible because of all the social pressure that comes from college admissions. But the reality is that what you do is going to matter far more than where you went when it comes to jobs or graduate school. That's because is more directly related to what you will bring to the table for your graduate college / future employer. Plus, if you are interested in attending grad school, where you go to grad school is going to be where people classify where you you went to college and your undergrad really won't matter (you won't want to be that people when asked where they went to college in their 20s or 30s has to stipulation where you went to undergrad as well). Believe me, almost all grad programs (even top tier stuff) care wayyyy more about your gpa and the amount of research you did in undergrad than the name of the school you went to.\n\n5. Consider going public!\n\nThis might seem like a bit out of left field but do not underestimate public universities, especially if you think you are someone like me that might be systematically devalued by college admissions officers. This is because public universities typically have much higher acceptance rates than their corresponding private counterparts meaning that you don't have to be as \"ideal\" from the lenses of a college admissions officer to get into a higher end program. Plus, there is a ton more social and academic mobility in a public university than my experience in private. As an example, if you take a 4.0 gpa student from University of Minnesota (not to pick on Minnesota, I just need an example) vs a student at an equivalently academically prestigious private college and assuming all else equal, Minnesota is easily going to be more impressive because being atop a sea of 50k+ students is way more impressive than beating out 2 - 10k students (not to mention Minnesota will probably be easier to get into with in the first place). Plus, the publics usually have larger alumni programs (and thus more likely to have really successful alumni to help you out) and way more name recognition when it comes to employment than a corresponding private college. This is important because it will make your application more memorable versus being from a great but ultimately forgettable or nationally unknown private college (with the exception of getting back into your college for their grad program). While I get it that public universities aren't typically seen a prestigious / fancy / exclusive than their private counterparts, when it comes to employment and graduate school opportunities, public is the way to go (plus not to mention, probably a way more fun social life and having more people will make it easier to find people like you).\n\nThanks for letting me ramble and talk about my experiences with the college admissions system. I'm not the best writer haha so apologies if some stuff comes off as clunky or repetitive. I would be happy to answer any question and remember that while in the moment it seems like everything, where you get into college on the first go doesn't matter as much as what you do when you get there and who you are <3."

Caltech on the other hand has not been as generous with financial aid as my other colleges have, even after appealing, and I'm still waiting on a final number from their fin aid office but it would be expensive. My parents are very supportive and willing to help me pay but I would probably be taking out some loans and it would be a financial burden on my family. \n\nI'm a physics major, and Caltech seems to be one of the best schools for physics, so I'm wondering if anyone had any thoughts on whether it's worth it or not? What exactly would I be paying for in terms of the difference - education, experience, community, research opportunities, etc? And how is physics at Duke?\n\nI still can't believe I got the scholarship and it has been a big wild card in the process of deciding where to go, so any input is appreciated. Thanks!"

    "body": "**TLDR: There are boxes to be checked as a pre-med, but please let this be proof that your non-medical interests** **are extremely valuable.**\n\nHi everyone!\n\nI've been apart of this subreddit since I was a freshmen in undergrad, and being able to finally post a Sankey feels so so surreal. I got my final decision back yesterday, and have been so excited to talk to other applicants on this forum that are similar to me. I'm going to breakdown some of the things I think made me successful, some of the things I could've done better, and in general, some things I wish I knew when I was where all of you are!!\n\n# STRENGTHS\n\n\\-ECs/life experience\n\n* I would search through Sankeys each year, and get nervous that my ECs didn't look like the ones that successful applicants had. Ultimately, I decided I didn't care. The activities I think made me standout most were:\n   * Exec member of Greek life\n   * 5 years of Experience as a D1 athlete and captain, especially one who suffered a pretty severe injury and bounced back\n   * Heavy involvement and leadership coordinating arts events, ultimately choosing an artistic minor and spending hundreds of hours on different events\n   * Advocacy work with sexual assault on a university and governmental level\n   * Teaching at an elementary school for a year\n   * Two research publications in MFM field\n\nAll of these activities were discussed more than any of my clincial work, research, or shadowing experiences (which I had plenty of, and got very lucky to wrack up hours and pubs in during my time off of school). **I took 2 gap years before applying because I didn't want to feel rushed, and wanted to have time to wrack up hours in the areas that I needed to before applying\\*\\***. I ultimately think the stories I was able to tell as a result of all of these activities is what made me successful.\\*\\* I didn't have to think all that hard about answering secondary or interview questions, because all of my stories were pretty unique. Most importantly? I had so much fun doing all of this.\n\n\\-LORS\n\n* My letter writers were mentors that I've known for almost 5 years in research positions, athletic team settings, art programs, and professors in my major. I had a few of them ask me if they could write a letter for me, and in general, had interviewers remark on how personal my LORs were. I focused a lot on building relationships with these people outside of a medical school setting, and it paid off well!\n\n\\-Writing\n\n* I can't even tell you how many drafts of my PS I went through before submitting it, but I know I sent it to like 10 different people. I have a lot of friends who are humanities majors, and I made sure to have them rip it to shreds with their editing. I agree with current advice that there is such thing as too much feedback, but I felt secure knowing I was submitting a PS that had been seen by people from a bunch of different backgrounds, and I got comments on how cohesive and descriptive my narrative was!\n* Secondaries: Even though I submitted everything by mid-August, I made sure that each essay I was submitting had been edited and reviewed by a handful of people, and was strategic with which ECs I mentioned for each school. I took the approach of highlighting activities that I thought aligned well with a school's mission, which I think worked out in my favor!\n\n# WEAKNESSES\n\n\\-Not enough interview prep\n\n* At a certain point I started to slack with prepping for each specific school, and I think my interviews towards the end of my cycle were not as strong as the ones in the beginning. Try to stay consistent with your routine, and if there's a school you know you don't want to attend, save your energy and decline the interview offer.\n\n\\-Stats\n\n* Again, I know I might get some pushback for putting this down as a weakness, but it's what my advisor kept bringing up to me. For the schools I was applying to, I was always bottom 10th or even completely absent from those little MSAR charts. My stats are fine for the majority of the schools in the country, but I received a lot of pressure from my advisor to retake my MCAT. I decided not to because that shit was #ass and I wanted to focus on my ECs instead. It was a gamble, but one that I think worked best for me.\n\n\\-Unfocused narrative\n\n* I had two interviewers at the same school mention they were confused by my motivation for medicine because of the non-medical activities I'd taken part in, and how my didn't paint a clear picture. I knew this was a risk I was taking by having so many non-medical activities on my application, and I ultimately caught the R from that school. I'm deeply passionate about education and mentorship, and created a narrative that showed that theme throughout my life in every facet, but I know that a student who is more traditionally research and clinically focused is what some schools are looking for. Completely and totally fine, but that is simply not me!\n\n# PARTING WORDS\n\nAt the end of the day I made it through the application cycle and my premed journey with not just my sanity, but also genuinely enjoying who I've become and feeling extremely happy and fulfilled. I would not have it any other way, and believe the schools I was accepted to are the ones that align best with who I am and what I hope to do in my life (spoiler alert: be happy). As pre-meds, we are WIRED to go hard at everything we do, and what I hope to do is provide some comfort for people who feel like they have to set their passions aside in pursuit of medical school. You don't. You shouldn't. You are an amazing person, and you deserve to follow whatever path you want to medicine. There is no rush, there is no right way to do it. :) I wish everyone well and am so open to questions!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzzlfrmoauoe1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=6276151530c7b2de108493fcdde5ad18bb2d06bb"

I had a nearly 4.0 major-specific GPA with a 3.7 overall, and i have two bachelors degrees, with the one i was trying to pursue graduate studies having an honors distinction. I also had quite a bit of extracurricular leadership experience from other organizations in my undergrad career.\n\nSo, I thought, with all of that, \"Oh, well, I'm sure to get in *SOMEWHERE*!\"\n\nSpoiler: I did not (lol). I received my last rejection yesterday, after having been put on a waitlist originally about a month prior. One school I still haven't heard from, but I don't expect to, nor was I planning on going if I were accepted.\n\nSo...yeah. I'm absolutely disappointed, at least a little. And I'm certainly a little angry at the fact that most (if not all) of those rejections were probably due to the funding issues going on.\n\n**However.**\n\nI'm approaching this whole situation with a particular point of view (and I do risk sounding a little bit not self-aware, here, but I will take that risk): **\"There is very little chance that any of this outcome is my fault.\"** I know I did my best, that I'm a strong applicant, and most importantly: *I know that the outcome of what happened was purely out of my control.* I think the situation of me being a senior in high school in 2020 - and therefore having to pivot my plans for where to go for undergrad - has changed my perspective when things like this happen. Life is always going to be stupid, and throw curveballs. What matters more is what I choose to do about it.\n\nI'm sharing all of this because I've been watching this subreddit, seeing people like me get rejected from schools, having their offers rescinded, and even more people being in danger of having to move back to their home countries given their student visas expiring when they graduate. I've even seen some CURRENT undergraduate students having their student visas revoked.\n\n**It's a scary, difficult time to be getting an education in the US, honestly.** And I know that all of us, myself included, are feeling a wide range of emotions about what is going on - whether you've been accepted into a program or not, or whether you're an international student or not.\n\nI want you to know: ***you are not alone.*** We see you.\n\nI'm choosing to celebrate those of us who got in - which, seriously, congratulations to you all, you have ultimate bragging rights, I think, haha - and comfort those of us who didn't. Because the most important thing right now is to keep a sense of community, especially when times like this happen.\n\nOverall, though, I'm sending love to everyone here, and everyone being affected by the bullcrap of the US. **We will get through this.** <3"

    "body": "Hi!\n\nI used to spend a lot of time on r/premed and r/postbaccpremed dooming about my chances of getting into medical school. I was 25/26, had done poorly in undergrad, and was working a job I hated, going nowhere. I was stuck in a cycle of self-doubt and depression. I wanted to share my story to offer hope to anyone who might be in the same boat as me.\n\nComing into undergrad, I was a mess. I had some pretty major negative life events happen in high school, and was not coping well. Struggling pretty much became a theme for the next four years. I struggled mentally and emotionally. I struggled in my coursework and just couldn't take things seriously. I majored in biology and scraped by, finishing my degree with a **3.0cGPA/2.6sGPA**. At one point, my GPA had dipped into the mid-2.0s. A few strong-ish semesters towards the end helped pull it up slightly, but I was still far from a competitive applicant.\n\nBecoming a doctor had been a dream of mine since I was a kid, but by the time I finished undergrad, I felt like I'd blown my chance. Needing money, I picked up what I intended to be a temporary job... then COVID hit. That 'temporary' job turned into three years of working in the chemical industry. Don't get me wrong - it was a good job! But I felt deeply unfulfilled. Suddenly I was 25, working a job I didn't love, watching my peers move on to new life chapters while I felt stuck in mine. So I decided to try to change that and chase after that old dream of medical school.\n\nI started studying for the MCAT and it was a pretty sad way of living - wake up, go to work, come home, study until bedtime, repeat. All my studying paid off - I made a 508! Because I was working full-time, I only managed to muster up about 30hr of shadowing, mostly primary care. Still, I figured I had a decent application. I applied to medical school.\n\nAnd I got nothing. Not even a secondary. I was crushed.\n\nI spent some time grieving, but decided to reach out to the schools I applied to and asked for application feedback. The common advice: do something to fix my GPA. My GPA was getting me filtered out quickly, and on top of that, I hadn't even taken a class in years. It made sense. I shuddered at the thought of having to do a post-bacc and go back to school, just to have the privilege to do more school. I spent another year waffling about before my wife had a come-to-Jesus meeting with me: either commit to med school, or give up on it.\n\nIt was the kick in the pants I needed. I started researching programs, and decided to apply to a year-long M.S. in Biomedical Sciences. After some careful deliberation and planning, I took the plunge - I left my decent-paying job and went back to school. And it was weird. I suddenly found myself surrounded by students fresh out of undergrad, your stereotypical \"type A\" premed types with mega impressive resumes looking to make their resumes even better. This time, I treated school like I treated my job, leaned on my real-world experience, and gave it everything I had. And so far, it's paying off! I am on track to finish my program with a 4.0!\n\nThe most valuable part of my program wasn't just the grades - it was the advising and professional development. Something that I would not have gotten by doing a DIY post-bacc. I had people around me pushing me to be more self-reflective. It forced me to think deeply about *why* I wanted to be a doctor, what  I wanted my future career to look like, and how to craft an application that reflects the growth I had experienced.\n\nI had always planned on finishing the program before reapplying. Midway through my first semester (July 2024) it was brought to my attention that my 508 MCAT score would be expiring before the 2025 cycle. I was advised to apply this cycle sort of as a trial run - just to get feelers on how my application has improved. And who knows? Maybe I'll get in. If not, I needed to prepare to take the MCAT again.\n\nSo, I threw together an application as quickly as I could - I was already behind! I poured everything I had into it. I wanted to show medical schools that I was a unique candidate. I felt like a diamond in the rough, that if a school was willing to take a chance on me, they wouldn't regret it. After a few months of biting my nails, I started to get secondaries! Then a few interviews! Before I knew it, **I was offered an acceptance in March 2025.** I'm not a perfect candidate by any means, and my stats will show that. Because of my program, I knew how to articulate the following things in my application: what I wanted out of medical school, who I am, and what I could contribute to whichever medical school chose me.\n\n**So what were the storytelling elements in my application?**\n\nYour application isn't just a CV of \"look at all the cool and impressive things I've done\". It's important to think of it as the story of you, the applicant. It's *your* story - explain your whys, your hows, your growth, what makes you *you*!\n\n* **I demonstrated my convictions and passions.** I grew up poor in a rural, medically-underserved region. As a kid, I never had role models. I always knew that *if* I could be a doctor, I would want to contribute to the place that I called home and help out kids who grew up like me. I didn't care about doing research, and I was clear about it. I made it clear that I knew what kind of physician I wanted to be: someone who practices in a rural area, someone who is an advocate for rural healthcare, and someone who contributes to their community. I built that narrative throughout my application - especially in the W&A section - showing how each experience shaped my own personal goals.\n* **I was upfront about my shortcomings and what I learned from them.** My GPA sucked. I owned it. I explained why I struggled in undergrad, and more importantly, what I've done since then to grow from it. I talked about my mental state in undergrad, how I felt like I lacked support, and how I've matured since then. I also described how I approach learning now, and I backed it up with stories, reflection, and recent success in my program. I didn't have a lot of shadowing hours - I worked full-time and truthfully didn't have the time to shadow. Once I started my program, I added hours in a few different specialties.\n* **I knew myself and the type of school I was looking for.** It seems like a lot of premeds are stuck in a \"what if they don't like me?' mindset. Flip it: \"Why should I like them?\" I applied to schools that aligned with my personal mission and my goals. I wanted to be a practicing physician, probably primary care, in a rural area. What good would it do me to apply to a school focused on research? I wasn't worried about prestige - I wanted fit. If research is your jam, lean into that - but demonstrate that message to schools that value it!\n* **I wasn't afraid to let my personality shine in my application.** I'll be honest - I'm a very casual person. Maybe a little too casual. I love conversation and have a certain way of talking, so I tried to weave that into my application. Don't be afraid to talk about hobbies in your W&A section!! You're not a robot!! I wrote about the Sunday league soccer team I captained, and how we won a flimsy plastic championship trophy in the fall. I wrote about how I love hiking - and how I proposed to my wife on the trail. I spoke about journaling and how I like to write about my day. But here's the key: I connected each of these to my personal growth. Sunday league helped me build leadership and team coordination skills. Hiking and journaling are stress relievers that help me reset. Show who you are - and why it matters!\n* **I reached out to schools during the application cycle.** This might be my favorite tip. As you read about schools and their programs, try emailing or setting up a meeting with faculty - especially if a program aligns with your goals. Be intentional and come prepared with well-thought out questions. Don't make it feel like you're just trying to cozy up to them; show genuine interest. Let's be honest here: we're all narcissists. We love talking about ourselves and what we do, and so do program directors. Most of them love speaking to prospective students, especially ones who demonstrate serious interest! A school I was interested in had a rural-rotation program for M3-M4 students. I spoke with the director at length about the program and my own career goals. I later learned that she went to bat for me during the admissions process. I had a few great conversations that helped me better understand the schools I was applying to, and honestly it helped me better understand myself. I'm sure it helped my application stand out, too.\n\nIf you're still here, thank you for reading. I understand that my advice does not apply to everyone, but if it helps even a single person out then I'm cool with that. And if you're someone who's been struggling, just know that there's always a path for you! You're not too old. You're not too far behind. You're not out of chances.\n\nI used to regret not going to medical school sooner. But now, I wouldn't trade my path for anything. The work I had to put in, the struggles, the growth, they all shaped who I am. They made me a better person, and I believe they'll make me a better doctor, too.\n\nIf you have questions, feel free to reach out to me via DM - I'll do my best to respond :)\n\n**Final Stats**\n\n3.0 cGPA, 2.6 sGPA -> 4.0 gGPA\n\n508 MCAT\n\n\\~80 hours shadowing (FM/IM/EM)\n\nZERO research experience\n\nApplied 07/24 > Secondaries 10/24 > Interviews 11/24-03/25 > Accepted 04/25 to my top choice"

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nThe past three days have been a really hard time for me, but I thought I'd reach out here for some honest but sympathetic advice on what I should do next.\n\nFor the past 10 months, I’ve worked as a clinical research coordinator at a top university, in a small lab (5 people total) under a PI I respected a lot. I genuinely thought I was doing well and listed the job prominently in my primary. I split the \\~1600 hours from the role into clinical (most meaningful) and research sections, included an anecdote in my personal statement, and had asked my PI back in March to write me a letter of recommendation, to which she agreed.\n\nThat all changed 3 weeks ago. All of a sudden on a Friday evening, my PI found a number of concerns in my work, and I learned that she'd be escalating them to HR without talking with me first (she texted my co-coordinator in a shared GC asking for emails and communications about my performance issues). This was the first I was hearing about performance concerns in my 10 months working there, and it completely blindsided me. I immediately scheduled a 1-on-1 with her, which she set for the following Wednesday.\n\nThe meeting was admittedly hard. Some of the concerns I understood and took responsibility for; others felt new or hadn’t been clearly communicated before. Still, I tried to improve in the following days and do my best to get back on track. But this past Friday, only 6 working days after the meeting, I was let go during my trial period for \"not meeting job expectations.\"\n\nI followed up with my PI over email afterward, politely asking if she would still be willing to write a letter. There's no reply yet, and I’m honestly not expecting one at this point\n\nNow I’m stuck between two major options:\n\n* **Do I move forward with my application without this LOR, and try to explain the situation gracefully in an update letter and/or secondaries?**\n* **Or do I withdraw, find a new position, retake my MCAT (which will expire next year), and apply again next cycle with stronger letters and more stability?**\n\nI'm doing my best to line up a new position ASAP, but I don't have one yet. I’m worried that withdrawing means giving up a cycle I already spent so much time and money preparing for, especially with AMCAS just getting verified. But I’m also terrified of having a massive red flag in my application without a letter from my most recent position, which I made a big deal of in my app.\n\nAny advice or perspective is really appreciated."

    "body": "After getting severely burnt out and voiding 2 MCATs in a row I've been doing some reflection.\nI'd like to share my long drawn out thoughts about why I want this job and y'all better share your thoughts and opinions as well.\n\nAcceptable \"Good\" Reasons\n\n- The work doctors do is directly about a PERSON you can see, hear, speak to, and potentially benefit or drastically harm, depending on how good you are. In a LOT of other jobs, workers feel disconnected from the result of their work and basically optimize for \"what do I need to do to not get criticized by my boss\". [Thought experiment]: What percentage of office workers would show up to work if their company offered them continuous pay forever, regardless of if they showed up. What about doctors? My guess is that almost all office workers wouldn't show up but many doctors would show up for patients.\n\n - Drugs, pharmacology, and biochemistry is just fascinating to me and I was the \"Did you know the chemical name of cocaine is benzoylmethylecgonine hydrochloride?\" kid in middle/high school. \n- I love how doctors get to learn and apply science and cutting edge technology which is subject to new and surprising breakthroughs.\n- Since I was a kid, whenever I was in a hospital I'd have the assured feeling, \"Yep, this is where I'm supposed to work.\" Never had that feeling anywhere else.\n\nB... b... but MA's also halp peepo!!\n\n\"Bad\" Shadow Side Reasons\n\n- Something about me just won't be satisfied with another job. I know that it would nag me forever.\n- God tier job security in a rapidly collapsing job market where people with bachelor's (that's me) can't even apply to Quik-Trip because drumroll..... they're not hiring\n- $$$. I want to travel and own a sick motorcycle. I also want to buy stuff for my family and friends. For example, I'd be able to take my best friend (a HS teacher) and his family on vacations. How cool would that be.\n- Attending MD is terminal. In your workplace, you are the leader and there's no one above you. Every doctor reaches this terminal point unless they quit. Unless we want to count insurance companies and the hospital admins but we're getting abstract.\n- An MD from the United States is the most valuable degree in the entire world and opens up MASSIVE opportunity job wise, entrepreneurially, socially, etc. \n\nReasons Not to Pursue Medicine\n\n- While I'm an insatiable learner, I actually HATE school. I spent about 10hrs per week (classes and homework) during my undergrad to lift weights and play vidya. I ended up with a 3.0cGPA, 3.0sGPA with a near perfect summer + senior year. I fixed my mindset towards the very end.\n- I hated both of my CNA jobs and voluntarily quit both of them. \n- I am somewhat artistic and have a great deal of trouble connecting with people. Even though I was good at my CNA job, actually connecting with patients did not come natural to me at all (even though it did happen sometimes).\n- I think that allopathic medicine is incredible at a lot of things but has major flaws that I reflect on a lot. \n\nWhat do you guys think? If you want, you can post your reasons in the same format and we can have a discussion!\n\nEdit: formatting"

    "body": "A year ago, I opened my REA decision from (what I thought was) my dream school to find out I had been rejected. While I knew going into it that highly selective college admissions can't be predicted by anyone or anything, I had let myself hope for an acceptance. As a naturally anxious person, it took a lot of effort to lean into that hope throughout the fall and not believe I'd be a de facto reject. I let myself believe the most likely result would be deferral, and that I would continue to finish my applications largely unaffected.\n\nWhile I did mourn the school itself, the hardest part of my rejection was how it changed my thinking about my college process as a whole. I felt stupid for letting myself hope, and began to believe my college list was too reachy—if I couldn't even get deferred from my early school, how would I get accepted to the similarly selective schools I was RDing to? It didn't help that it felt like everyone I knew was bound to a school through an ED acceptance while I trudged through finishing my applications.\n\nThree months later, I was accepted to nearly every school I applied to. Past that early rejection, only two colleges did not send me an offer of admission. Even the essays I wrote in a hurry, fully believing that there was no point spending time with painstaking editing because I was bound for rejection, worked. I know now that if I had chosen to apply early to virtually any school on my list other than my REA school, I would have been accepted—and I am so, so thankful I didn't do that, and got rejected instead.\n\nI would have never in a million years applied ED to the school I chose. It was the last college I toured and the last school I decided to apply to. I didn't think I would get accepted, much less attend. While I can't say I can't imagine myself anywhere else—people are right when they say you can be happy at any institution—I absolutely and totally cannot FATHOM attending my REA school. I would have never felt comfortable expanding my horizons the way I have since coming to college if I was at a school with a classic grind culture—and, more importantly, if I felt like I was culminating my high school dreams by going to college. Being in a place I never expected to be means I have total freedom. I have more friends than I've ever had before—not just friends of convenience, but people I have genuine connections to. I love college as much as I dreamed I would. I know I wouldn't feel the same if I went to my \"dream school.\"\n\nGetting rejected from Yale was one of the best things to ever happen to me. I mean that genuinely. I know the \"rejection is redirection\" phrase can feel cliché and often painful, but know that things really do work out the way everyone tells you they will. Know, also, that it's never stupid to hope. One school's decision has no bearing on any other decision, and, more importantly, has no bearing on your accomplishments and efforts that have gotten you this far. Last year, I was so terrified of hope that I decided against ED2 in fear of opening another rejection letter. I didn't get over that fear until I got my first major RD-round acceptance. Don't do that!!! Let your hopes and desires carry you through the rest of this process, and know that surprises can be the biggest blessings."

    "body": "I live in Houston, where we got hit hard fairly regularly by hurricanes, tropical storms, and other flooding events. But while my house has never flooded, thank goodness, our home was nearly destroyed by a fire in 1996, and it took over a year to rebuild. To say, it was traumatizing would be minimizing. Searching through your house for any possible photographs or mementos of your life that weren’t damaged by the fire or the water from fire hoses is unbearably difficult. Still, fires, like hurricanes and other major life events, make you realize what's important in life. Photographs, pets, medicine, and other essentials need to be grabbed if possible when evacuating, but otherwise, stuff is stuff, and as long as we are all ok, then that's a good thing – even though it doesn’t feel like that right now I’m sure. ⠀ ⠀\n\nIf you’re in Los Angeles County or anywhere else affected by natural disasters, I'm thinking about you. I also know many of you in the south and in the gulf coast might still be recovering from Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the middle of the entire country just got hit by a massive snow system at the same time as the LA fires. Please know that if your home or your family or your school has been affected, for now, college applications can wait. Focus on taking care of yourselves , your families, your neighbors, and your friends. I speak from experience when I say that searching through ash to see what is left in your house is beyond awful. I hope that you and your family have found safe places to be, but even as I write this I know the wind is supposed to pick back up, and there’s still a threat of more fires. It’s hard to focus – for me, too. I have two adult children living in Los Angeles, and more than a handful of cousins, friends, and work acquaintances have been affected as well.. \n\nLet’s just be real too -- fires, hurricanes, and massive snow storms are stressful and scary under the best of circumstances, but when you add in all the normal college admissions work, that’s next-level stress. Please know that most (if not all) colleges will understand the amount of stress you and your families are going through now. Some of you may be without a home or power for weeks or months -- or more. If you haven’t yet applied, you can explain that to them in the Additional Information section of your application. And when you get power, you can also reach out to your admissions officers and tell them. If you need fee waivers, explain your situation and ask for them. If you need an extension, and they’re not providing one, ask. It can never hurt to ask them. Also, if these weather events are causing you and your family to rethink your financial situation, be sure that you begin communicating with the financial aid offices.  ⠀\n\n**Here’s a list of some colleges that have released statements and deadline extensions for those affected by the fires** *(please share if you know more! I’d love to crowdsource this post)*: \n\n* [USC:](https://admission.usc.edu/?utm_campaign=Brand&utm_medium=website&utm_source=USC%20Homepage)  “We know that some students and their families are currently facing significant challenges from the fires in the Los Angeles area. If you will be unable to submit your Common App by the January 15 Regular Decision deadline, please reach out to your admission counselor at [admission.usc.edu/admission-counselors](https://admission.usc.edu/admission-counselors). We’re keeping our neighbors in our thoughts.”\n* [Occidental: ](https://www.oxy.edu/admission-aid/apply) “NOTE: With the fires and high winds impacting so many in Southern California, we’re extending the application deadline to prioritize the safety and well-being of those in the affected region. Applicants from the affected zones in Southern California will have until midnight on January 17 to submit their admission and financial aid applications.”\n* [Loyola Marymount University:](https://admission.lmu.edu/) “We are committed to supporting any student whose LMU application process has been impacted by the recent fires in Los Angeles. If you need additional time to complete your application, require an application fee waiver due to unexpected financial challenges, or have any other requests, please email us at [admission@lmu.edu](mailto:admission@lmu.edu).”\n* [Lewis & Clark College:](https://college.lclark.edu/offices/admissions/?_gl=1*1qc4lpo*_ga*MTUxMjczMDI3Mi4xNzM2NzEzMDI2*_ga_6MKT6LMD5S*MTczNjcxMzAyNS4xLjAuMTczNjcxMzAyNS42MC4wLjA.) “California Wildfires: Your community has been in our thoughts as we watch the news unfold regarding the California wildfires and the ongoing impact and recovery. We hope you and your family are okay.College applications may feel like an added stress in this complex time. We would like to offer Los Angeles-area students extra time to submit their application. Don’t worry about our upcoming January 15 application deadline or any additional emails you may receive about that deadline; *we will work with you, on your timeline, when you are ready.* Contact your admissions counselor if you have any questions.”\n* I’ve heard of a handful of other colleges who will work with you and your counselors, but really any college is worth reaching out to if their deadline hadn’t passed before January 7. \n\n**Important Note:** These extensions are not necessarily for everyone. If you are not in an area that has been directly impacted by the LA Fires, don’t assume that your deadline has been extended. \n\nIf you have been affected by the Los Angeles fires (or other weather event), but the colleges you’re applying to haven’t been proactive and made a statement about their deadline changes, it's totally ok to reach out and ask for extensions. \n\n**Reach out by Email:** You can email both your regional admissions counselor if they have one and the general admissions email. I usually suggest doing both if possible. You should also reach out to the financial aid office if you need. Make sure you include any new mailing address and contact information. Your email should be short and sweet and could go something like this: \n\nHello \\[Name of Admissions Counselor\\] and \\[University Name\\] Admissions,\n\nUnfortunately, my family was impacted recently by the (specific fire name)in Los Angeles, making your RD deadline of \\[add date\\] difficult because of …. \\[lack of housing, electricity, internet, family members who are struggling, etc\\]. Is there any way I can get an extension?  \n\nThank you for your support,\n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n\\[New Address and contact information if necessary\\]\n\n\\[City, State\\]\n\n**Use the Additional Information Section:** Don’t forget – you can also use the Additional Information section to tell your story if you haven’t yet applied. Explain the effects of the fires (or other weather event) on your community, home, family, and you. Tell how you have had to cope with and recover – even as you are still in the process of cleaning up and figuring out how to move forward. End with lessons learned. \n\nI am also including here a link[ from CollegeWise](https://go.collegewise.com/la-fires-support?utm_campaign=Webinar%20Promo%20Emails&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gvTN2Hwbra8yTfDhLfGVWJUDMtrVqdC9BxCRBfIcwDnFX1F95WBVD_9gC26yjgb3SnvHpn4WSGhfJB9V4-4bM6T7SGUp8LMBfX6tBZbwsxO29AKE&_hsmi=342011005&utm_content=342011005&utm_source=hs_email), with some helpful information for students and parents. \n\n**Tl;dr:** \n\n* If you’ve been affected by a natural disaster like the Palisades or Eaton Fires in Los Angeles, focus on helping your families right now. You have time for college applications\n* Reach out to colleges and see if they’ve made statements about extensions or fee waivers for affected students, or if they haven’t – and you need one, ask\n* If your financial situation and/or contact information have changed, be sure to update colleges when you have the time to do so\n* If you haven’t yet applied, use the Additional Information section to explain your situation if you feel you have a story that will affect your applications\n\n"

all i was was a teen who was fat with no self confidence, and unfortunately all of this eventually caught up to me and made me fall behind on my studies. it made me not be able to focus on studying for the sat, for any external exams, or any school exams. i booked some online therapy sessions because i had no one to help me otherwise, and that's when i started to change. overtime, i became better gradually. i had reached my senior year by the time i actually started to feel like i'm myself. i tried to build my way up and catch up, but by then the damage was too much and nothing could be done. i became too skinny for my own good, i still couldn't sleep for some nights, and i tried my best to catch up with my studies for sat but by then it was too late. college applications were around the corner and no matter how hard i tried i couldn't get a great score in any of my exams whether it be school or external. my achievements weren't enough. my best ecs consisted of a prepatory program in grade 11 ( 135 hours ap prep/toastmasters\ntop 500 students out of 3000 applicants\n120 graduates from region), co-founder of DSAT Scholars Enrichment, the biggest student-led online SAT community(whatsapp) in my country with over 600 students( Our Community has helped numerous students get 1450+ SAT scores), head Of my schools Article/Chronicle Editorial Committee in which we release an article bi-weekly,  Deputy-Secretary General of my school's Model United Nations Conference, Secretary General of my own student-led Model United Nations, 1 week 25 hour job shadowing program at a hospital, currently preparing for a public presentation competition with two fellow students, and the topic we chose was e-waste management; the presentation will be at a university in front of a few hundred students, main leader for my volleyball team in this year's annual volleyball tournament at my school, participated in the Jordanian entrepreneurship contest (entrogate) with my team in 11th grade and reached the semi-finals and acting as a guide for this year's grade 11 batch in their participation for the same program, achieved 3rd place in a daily neuroscience club questionnaire, currently working on launching my own mental health online club/space called FreeMind in which people can have their voices heard in the way I always wanted to. it may seem ironic that i am a co-founder of the biggest sat community in my country yet didn't achieve a good sat score, but, again, by the time i started being me and trying to lock in and focus on sat Scores, it was too late and nothing i could do helped no matter how hard i studied and no one knew about my struggle but me. i don't know whether to try to appeal some rejections and include this story or just give up and let go since this is my dream, and i don't know if i should just try to apply as a new applicant for the spring term instead of appealing my rejections. i only have 1 waitlist and that's it and i'm extremely devastated and don't know what to do. it seems that no matter how hard i tried to get back on my feet it was always too late and i had already been knocked down. if only i had someone there to help me when i needed someone then i would be in a good place, thats the goal i'm aiming for right now, to help others in the way i once longed to be helped. now looking at myself i can't help but think i'm not as smart or capable as i thought i was. i feel like a failure and like i'm back to square one and it's killing me...\n"

But it's definitely not easy to figure out how to do it \"right\" when you're given so much flexibility and so little instructions.\n\nI get requests from frustrated applicants every year, and many of them ask the same questions: \"What prompt am I supposed to choose?\" \"Is this supposed to be full-on creative, or should I showcase some of my skills/experience?\" \"What exactly are they looking for with this essay?\"\n\nAll of these questions are valid and important. I feel like I've finally gone through this process with enough students to write a post about my take. My goal is to help out anyone who's thinking about applying to UChicago but are a little intimidated by the essay.\n\n**Disclaimer**: This is by no means a \"definitive\" guide. There is not a singular \"perfect\" way to approach the UChicago uncommon essay, or any essay for that matter. I'm merely sharing my opinions, which are synthesized from my own experience as an applicant and as a mentor for other successful applicants.\n\nHope this can sway some of you who are on the fence into the right direction (and good luck to those who have already submitted ED0)!\n\n\\*please excuse any typos\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\nWhat exactly is UChicago looking for?\n\nBefore you start the essay, you really need to figure out this question. Like with any other college, you need to understand the *type* of student that the AO is looking for to best tailor your narrative. Many students make the mistake of tweaking the wording for different schools while keeping the same core ideas. This is an easy mistake to make when many of the prompts seem similar (like \"why school\" or \"why major\"). But generalizing your responses is not a good strategy because every school's angle is different, and you're giving up the golden opportunity to speak to each school's vision and maximize your chances.\n\nThe idea is the exact same with UChicago - except the task *literally* forces you to tailor your response. The UChicago app enforces more self-selection because of the unique prompt, but in reality, every school looks for a different set of traits regardless of how similar the prompts might seem.\n\nThis is exactly why I'm saying that the Uncommon essay could be a great opportunity to showcase yourself. Compared to how easy it is to write generic stuff for common prompts, the Uncommon essay literally makes it impossible for you to do so. Unfortunately, many students do not realize the value of the prompt's design and either 1. pass up on it entirely or 2. write some generic fluff while complaining about how annoying it is.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\nNow, how do you do it right?\n\nLet's start with choosing the prompt. I recommend avoiding analysis paralysis and letting your instinct guide you. Usually students don't have too much trouble finding one or two that speak to them after reading through the near-infinite list. Unless you really really hate all of them (very very unlikely), you should go with a pre-existing prompt instead of coming up with your own.\n\nEither way you shouldn't spend too much time analyzing the prompts, because your response matters a lot more than the question. A creative response to a basic question is always better than a boring response to an interesting question.\n\nOnce you have an initial idea, it's time to double down. I'm an advocate for committing to a prompt once you've made any progress. Even if you start to hate your first idea, focusing on one prompt allows you to dig deeper and discover new angles. I'm issuing a preemptive warning to students like me who are very thorough and prone to overthinking (ironically a common trait at UChicago). DO NOT BE SCARED TO COMMIT.\n\nI'd approach the writing process like the Personal Statement. Start early and give yourself space to think instead of doing it in one go. Most students I know pivot 3+ times before settling on a final story, myself included. There are many important decisions to make:\n\n>1. What is your literal response to the question?\n\nIf you had to respond to the question in one sentence, what would it be? This would be the guidepost to your essay, but it does not have to be explicitly written out in your essay.\n\n>2. What style of writing are you going for?\n\nAre you trying to approach the prompt through an argumentative, creative, or narrative lens? Most students do a combination of the three, and if so, what percentage of each are you using? What is the overall tone of voice (philosophical, humorous, fantastical...)?\n\nThe sky is the limit here. I would recommend balancing being adventurous and doing what you're best at. Let your strengths shine, but don't be afraid to experiment with styles you aren't used to. I really believe that the writing process could be enjoyable this way.\n\n>3. What traits are you demonstrating through this essay?\n\nJust like the Personal Statement, this essay needs to be wielded into a piece of armor that strengthens your profile. Whether it's your domain expertise, creativity, mastery of language, or a unique life experience, you need to use the prompt to highlight something special about you. If you've read some sample essays, you'll see some common traits emerge regardless of how exactly the essay is written - these underlying signals what the readers are looking for.\n\nStyle is important but don't let it take over the substance.\n\n>4. How does this fit within your profile?\n\nWhile you could zoom in on something hyper-specific with this 650-word essay, you still need to consider how it compliments your entire narrative on paper. How does your response showcase something you haven't mentioned elsewhere? How can you make a case for yourself as a prospective UChicago student? How does it add to your multidimensionality and help readers know you better?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\nHow exactly you make these decisions is very very specific to you; there is no one-size-fit-all solution. But I find the general methodology here to be helpful for 99% of students. Even if you don't follow any of the steps I outlined, just understanding the ideology behind this prompt would make the process 100x smoother and more enjoyable for you (I realize that the Life of the Mind is really coming through in this post). \n\nThe UChicago prompt is intentionally self-selective, but I personally believe that anyone could write a great Uncommon essay. You shouldn't let the prompt discourage you if the school itself interests you in any way.\n\nAs an aside: I know some people are saying that the Common App is ruining school-specific \"culture.\" While I couldn't agree more with preserving culture and legacy, with the increasing competition every year, the best thing any applicant could do is to understand the vision of each school and give it your best shot. I genuinely think that every 18-year-old is malleable and the Life of the Mind is not dead (yet).\n\nIf you signed up for the game, you might as well play it right.\n\nGood luck and I'll try to answer any questions."

    "body": "\\[First World Problems - You Don't Have to Entertain Me if You Don't Want to\\]\n\nLast year, I committed to a top private university and took a deferral year. Our family doesn't qualify for financial aid and I didn't receive any merit scholarships. Going into this fall, I am currently majoring in neuroscience and am on the pre-med track at this university. My parents are upper-middle class in the Bay Area. They are immigrants and have worked hard to get where they are. I went to a private high school and half of my friends doing pre med went to public schools (UCs) and the other half went private. I have a younger brother than is also currently attending a private high school.\n\nAfter talking with my friends and doing some more research into pre-med, I realized that I made a mistake. Since undergraduate university doesn't matter for pre-med I should've gone to one of the UCs to save money. I feel so idiotic and guilty that I didn't plan things better. They are able to pay for my tuition, but it is not an insignificant portion of their earnings and we live in an expensive location. I am eternally grateful but I feel like I am doing them wrong.\n\nSo, I talked to them about how awful I felt. That I don't think paying full tuition is worth it and that I should've gone to a state university instead. I suggested that even though I can't transfer sophomore year, I can transfer to a UC for junior and senior year. They were strongly against it and even got angry about it. They said that they are more than happy to be able to pay for the university I wanted to get into and that they want me to be successful and finish my degree there. They are also strongly against public universities for pre-med (even the UCs) because they think it will be hard for me to maintain my GPA there. I am aware of that but I completely disagree with them. Over the past month, we've have countless arguments about this.\n\nI struggle with anxiety so I think about this often and feel quite guilty as a result. I am worried of the financial strain when my brother goes to university, despite my parents saying that they can handle it too. Should I transfer to a UC after two years despite it going against everything they tell me and make them angry with me? Community college isn't an option since that is the last thing they want. Or should I just stick it out for 4 years like they told me to and stomach the guilt? Wherever I go, I will do my best in an effort to make it worthwhile for them. It's just that I don't want them to pay so much money for a school I don't even feel is worth it for what I'm trying to do.\n\nI am aware that this comes of as entitled and for that I apologize. I am trying to be more aware of how grateful I should and need to be."

It's just that there are so many good schools out there that I think I could have a chance, and some I reacherched and found that I really liked, and it's a little crushing that I can't attend them because of money.\n\nEven with financial aid, 30k is 30k.

Hell, even 20k is just despair inducing. \n\nThere's a whole lot of everything else, and this isn't the full picture, but it is what it is. \n\nI plan to go into either cs, math, stats, and then into DS for my masters, and I was wondering how much my university would affect my career. \n\n"

The longer I coached, the more I appreciated the longitudinal relationships I developed with clients, and the more interested I became in helping them manage their medical issues. After exploring physical therapy, dietetics, and medicine, medicine was the only choice for me.\n\n2) I was taught to be an evidence-based practitioner early on, learning to read and interpret scientific literature while developing my assessment, planning, listening, and communication skills. This commitment to scientific integrity was evident in my writing and in interviews.\n\n3) I have extensive experience as an educator and value mentoring those who aim to do what I do. I made it clear that I want to be involved in medical education, in addition to caring for patients in a primary care setting.\n\n4) The social nature of coaching helped me develop my voice and confidence in who I am and what I stand for. I wasn't nervous in interviews and enjoyed the conversations I had. Being a bit older also helped in this regard. I feel interviewers tended to see me as an adult first and a student second. Being non-traditional also means having extensive work experience in other fields to draw answers from. I have had plenty of experience working with diverse groups, handling conflicts, approaching disagreements, and fostering a healthy team environment. Interviews felt easy because of this.\n\n5) Having a creative and performing arts background while also being an athlete made for plenty of interesting conversation. The traditional interviews I had focused more on my background in these areas than anything related to medicine."

    "body": "It seems like no one really has a clear idea on what to do EC-wise, so I thought I'd make a quick guide from my personal experience and from reading basically every single verifiable source remotely related to college (thanks AdmissionsMom and Ben-MA!) I know my account doesn't have any karma, but that's cuz I got doxxed so I deleted my old account lol\n\nIf you're like \"that guy\" who is qualifying for USAMO every year, building nuclear reactors in your garage, whatever, this is not for you. Y'all are gonna do fine regardless, I'd hope. And by following this template, you will not be \"that guy\", but I think you'll appeal to colleges by being a mere mortal, but a dedicated and hardworking mere mortal.\n\nSo, here's a breakdown of what a pretty competitive applicant typically looks like:\n\n**2 academic clubs:**\n\nBy academic clubs, I don't mean just things like \"math team\" - any club at your school that uses your brain (DECA, MUN, HOSA, Robotics, etc) will suffice. If anything, I'd suggest avoiding clubs related purely to a subject like math/science - hard to stand out, and your academic excellence should already be verified by your grades. Something that combines multiple skills like DECA or robotics, although similarly basic, show more about your skills being applied to a real-world context (not just answering MCQs). The exception, I would say, is if you're majoring in that subject - if you're a Math or Stats major, you should definitely be on your school's math team. Stick to 1-3 though, don't just join 7 clubs and do nothing in any of them. Quality >>> quality.\n\nWithin the club, there's two things you should be aiming for: leadership and awards.\n\nRegarding leadership, school is one of the best environments to showcase your ability to lead your peers. Join the club freshman year, try to make friends with the existing officer team, be a present and known member, do whatever you need to get president. If your club has leadership beyond that (like DECA has district/state officer), go for that too. Be a leader.\n\nRegarding awards, this is also one of the best places to show verifiable competency. Try to get to the national equivalent of whatever you're going for (HOSA ILC, DECA ICDC, Robotics Worlds) if you can. Again, you should be stacked with awards come senior year, and there shouldn't be any question that you're one of the best in your area at this.\n\nAs a freshman, join a bunch of clubs and figure out which ones your natural talents play to, which ones you enjoy, which ones have the best opportunity to get that beautiful leadership + awards combo. For example, at my high school in Texas, no one in my grade (now a senior) has ever made it past robotics states. On the other hand, we send a few dozen people to DECA ICDC every year, and typically get some top 20 or top 3 international placements there. At my school, I'd heavily lean towards joining DECA unless you think you can really be that guy at robotics. After a year in every interesting club, pick the 1-3 that best fit all the criteria and get that leadership + awards sophomore and junior year.\n\n**1 volunteering commitment:**\n\nWithin your volunteering, again, two things to be aiming for: leadership and public service. Colleges want to see that you're a good person, and they want to see that you make a big impact on initiatives you join. IMO, it doesn't really matter what type of volunteering you do, so I'd pick something that you enjoy and can maybe do with friends. I'd make sure that whatever you're doing does address some sort of societal issue, though, so I'd pick something related to the homeless, disabled, natural disasters, or something else like that - maybe pass on, say, tutoring.\n\nAnd once again, within the initiative, try to be some kind of leader or gain some sort of important position. Obviously, this varies heavily from organization to organization, but just do your best to rise in the ranks of whatever you do join.\n\nRegarding time commitment, I think 2-3 hours a week is a nice balance of consistency while also being able to balance other things. I personally really liked volunteering from, say, 9-12 in the morning on Sundays. No one's really doing anything anyway on Sunday mornings, it's nice to be out of the house at that time, and it helps you avoid the trap of waking up at 11 AM on weekends. You do you, obviously, but 3 hours a week isn't really much on a week to week basis and it adds up quickly - that's around 500 hours by the time college apps comes around, and that's more than enough to show you're dedicated to the cause.\n\n**1 sport:**\n\nThis one serves a few different purposes: shows a different side of yourself, yet another opportunity to show leadership, and shows you're not totally a nerd. As for which sport to join, pick the one you can most likely get varsity for and that you'd actually enjoy playing - don't go too deep for this one. The ultimate goal for this sport is to be a Varsity Captain (or equivalent) by senior year, so maybe don't join your nationally ranked cross-country team as a total newbie - opt for golf or water polo instead.\n\nAgain, key thing here is to make sure you're having fun - trust me, playing a sport you don't like is pure torture, and playing a sport you do like (and rock at) is SUPER fun.\n\n**1 hobby:**\n\nThis one is totally up to you - with a few key caveats. Please, for god's sake, don't use Rubik's cubes as your hobby. Don't use competitive programming or math or violin or piano or any of the basic ones here. If you truly do enjoy those things, continue to enjoy them, but also go out of your way to find something just a little bit unique: rock-climbing, or hiking, or producing music, or skateboarding, or something. A few tests to see if your hobby is cool:\n\n* If you told other people about your hobby, would they be like \"Wait that's so cool!\" or \"Yeah, figures\"?\n* How many other people do you know who do this hobby?\n* Do you honestly, truly get excited when doing it?\n* Is it something that could serve no purpose other than to have fun?\n\nJust please have fun guys don't be robots.\n\n**2 summer experiences:**\n\nNo one's locked in freshman summer, but you should try to focus on one big thing during both your sophomore and junior year summers. This can be research, internships, summer programs, whatever floats your boat. Preferably like 4-8 weeks, and pretty much a full-time commitment during that time. Realistically, with this approach, you can still have a pretty fun summer while showing that you didn't just waste your time - a 40-hour/wk internship is like going to school with no homework, no tests, and no other ECs to manage. I think it's pretty doable for most people shooting for top schools.\n\nAdditionally, I think this is where my prestige whores can really shine. With these opportunities, I'd target verifiable prestige over pretty much anything else. Everyone says they \"did research\" \"shadowed a physican\" \"interned at xyz\" etc. Meanwhile, AOs know that half of them just half-assed or nepo-ed their way into a \"prestigious\" position. Compared to something like SSP, NASA SEES, etc - those are clear opportunities that can't be faked, can't be half-assed, can't be bought, and are known for students doing something meaningful. With these opportunities, whatever you go for, try your best to make sure it's something official so you get the stamp of credibility right off the bat.\n\n**1 part-time job:**\n\nYou've got all these beautiful extracurriculars, but you're also just a humble guy making minimum wage. And, honestly, a part-time job is actually a good thing to have even if your parents are Bay Area PHDs. AOs know it teaches you responsibility, how the real world works, etc. And again, try to get leadership - get that manager position, make those bands. It doesn't really matter where you work except again, I'd avoid anything academic here like tutoring. Get a job at Nike, Five Guys, ref a rec league, do whatever, but keep it out of the classroom. Don't feel the need to work an insane amount (assuming you don't need the money), maybe like a shift or two a week? Obviously, it's hard to keep up with this sort of thing along with everything else you're doing, so don't make it a huge priority. Try to get one with flexibility, if possible, so you don't get saddled with a shift the day before a Physics test.\n\n**2 \"special sauces\":**\n\nThis is where you really shine. The rest of the stuff is cool, and it's important that you don't skimp on them because they show a lot of important qualities, but ultimately everything up until this point is still fairly common stuff. It provides a beautiful background, but you need the shining stars of your application to be something only you've done. Ideally, these would be related to your major, but they don't really have to be. I can't give much advice about these ones, but I'd treat it kind of like a startup - find a problem in your community (or globally) that needs to be solved, try to come up with a solution, and implement it to the best of your ability. Any sort of recognition from these endeavors is awesome, but the main thing is that there's clear impact on your community and again, that it's unique. As a bit of litmus test, think:\n\n* Who am I actually helping, and how am I actually helping them?\n* Would I get doxxed if I posted it on Reddit and someone from my school saw it? (what happened to me LOL)\n* How can colleges get proof that I did something?\n\nAgain, really dig deep for finding something here. People start BS non-profits, but don't do ts. Host a city-wide farmer's market for kids, start a company that addresses a local problem, build and publish an app that helps old ladies feel less lonely. Don't use those specifically because if I can come up with it on the spot randomly, it's probably not the greatest idea, but ykwim. Idk take your pick, but this is where you really shine.\n\nAnd that's 10 ECs, exactly what the Common App asks for! Every single one shows a positive aspect of you in some way, every single one shows deep commitment to something, and every one is verifiable.\n\nRegarding awards, I think people fixate on this WAY too much (unless you're like winning Olympiads and stuff; then by all means, fixate away). But in any case, if you've done this right, you should have:\n\n* Big award from club 1\n* Big award from club 2\n* Something related to your sport (possibly)\n* Some other competition related to your major\n\nAnd really I don't think you'd need more than that.\n\nAgain, it is a lot of hours, but a lot of it should be pretty fun if you're doing it right:\n\n* neither volunteering nor your hobby should even feel like work\n* sports are tiring, but hanging out with your teammates is awesome, and I think most of the athletes I know wouldn't trade it for the world + stay in shape my fellow CS majors; you will pull more\n* clubs kind of depends on the time commitment, personally I did DECA and a CS thing in Texas called CSUIL, both of which are pretty chill (and I made top 10 & 20 ICDC for DECA), stuff like robotics is definitely a lot more though\n* part-time job try to get one that you can kind of autopilot, massive bonus points if you have/make a friend cuz it makes the whole experience sm better\n* summer experiences are n/a during the school year, and during the summer u only have to think about that one thing\n* your \"special sauces\" are where the time can really go depending on what they are\n\nI'd love thoughts from more verified sources, but I feel like this is a pretty good guide for someone who's totally lost on what they should be doing. Don't feel forced to stick to this particular guide, of course, but I think it gives a sense of the general direction that you should go for. Best of luck to everyone else applying this year!"

    "body": "I am currently attending a tiny (\\~1200 students) 4 year private christian school. I’m a freshman, and at first I loved it. I found a lot of people to hang out with, but I don’t have a ton in common with the people here.\n\nI’m an engineering major… and let’s just say the program here is pretty terrible. And even worse, none of the students really care about engineering as a hobby, more as just a way to get that piece of paper on graduation day. This is the complete opposite of my public high school, which had probably the best engineering program in the state for a high school, it was unbelievably good and I had a ton of friends and we were all super involved and really close.\n\nWhy did I choose to go there? Everyone talked about the community here, and sure, it’s great if you’re a certain type of person, but I’m not that person.\n\nI don’t want to come off arrogant when I say this, but I almost feel like I’m too intelligent to be going to this school. Everyone here (it’s a small christian school) basically says that for anything that takes too much thinking to answer, the answer is just God. And no one stops for a second to treat the Bible as any other historical document and just assumes it to be true because the Bible says it is (circular reasoning). Not even sure what I believe regarding God anymore, but I sure as hell want to get the hell out of here.\n\nDon’t get me wrong— I’m not bragging that I’m super smart of something. I just feel alone because it’s crazy to me how these people don’t realize how blind they are to reality. I thought at a school \"acclaimed for its intellect\" we would just be fed religious propaganda with no evidence. Nope.\n\nI’m in a really weird position. In high school, right after quarantine, there was about half a year where I didn’t have any friends at first, but I made some really really good friends. But here, I have friends, but I don't have much in common with them and they're pretty boring. I wanna do fun shit but all they want to do to hang out is watch a movie in the evening in an empty classroom or wander around campus.\n\nWhen I was lonely during my first 6 months of high school, at least I had the option to meet more people. Now becuase of this school's tiny size I literally know everyone so there really isn't more people to meet. Joining the few clubs that they have won't help becuase I already know the people in them. There's no one left for me to meet.\n\nNow it's week 9 of my freshmen year and I feel like I'm wasting my college experience, my education in the lame excuse for an engineering major, and mainly my parent's money. They paid nearly $20k for this semester alone for this crappy school.\n\nAnd I'm pretty alone in feeling this too. Everyone else loves this school becuase it's bringing them \"closer to God\" or something. Well screw that, I just want a good education and good friends.\n\nMy senior year of high school was actually awesome, I really miss public school and the open mindedness of people there, willing to actually use their critical thinking and act like scholars.\n\nSorry for the long post. Anyways. What are my options? I really don't want to waste another 20 grand of my parents money on this shitty school. Ideally I'd go to community college next semester and then transfer as a sophomore. I really **don't** want to transfer as a Junior. My high school GPA wasn't the greatest (\\~3.0) becuase of numerous reasons, mainly untreated ADHD but I won't get into that right now.\n\nShould I go to community college next semester? Are there any decently good schools I can apply to as a transfer Sophomore year? I just really need a change and don't want to be here next semester. Please help. I'm really regretting coming here and wish I could go back in time.\n\nEdit:  \nI really want to transfer to a 4-year college starting next year. Is this at all a possibility?"

    "body": "I've gotten all my decisions for MS in EE/ECE except UCSD, which I will withdraw from. Had a lot of thoughts and reflections about this process I want to share before signing off, and hope they can also help ppl currently waiting on decisions or those who are applying or thinking of applying at the moment in some way.\n\nFirst I wanna thank everyone on this forum for keeping me sane throughout this process. I found comfort in sharing the stress and anxiety that comes with getting rec letters, writing essays, doing research, and of course, experiencing the waiting game. Even though I'm more of a passive scroller, I always get excited when I hear everyone's reactions, advice, polls, etc. Sharing your acceptances and reactions brings me a lot of joy. Ok, now onto the application stuff!\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBackground: I'm a senior undergrad majoring in Computer Science at a public uni. During my junior year, I found my passion for lower-level systems and software-hardware intersections, so I applied to  EE/ECE programs for grad school. \n\nResults are below:\n\n* Princeton MS CS: Rejected\n* Stanford MS EE: Rejected\n* UC Berkeley MS EECS: Rejected\n* UPenn MSE EE: Accepted\n* CMU MS ECE: Accepted\n* Georgia Tech MS ECE: Accepted\n* UMich MS ECE: Accepted\n* UIUC MS ECE: Accepted + tuition waived for 1 year + TA role offer\n* USC MS Computer Engineering: Accepted + 20k scholarship\n\nI'm not from a T20 uni, and in fact, I was only accepted to 1 school (the one I'm currently going to) during my undergrad college applications. As a result, I'm quite shocked about this cycle. I feel extremely lucky and grateful for being in a position where I have the flexibility to choose between programs. And wanted to share some things I've learned.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, no matter which school you go to, you can always choose the people that you surround yourself with, and there will always be a group that you can vibe with (as long as you're proactive about finding them). A lot of my personal development, motivation for grad school, and desire to aim higher stemmed from interactions with my peers who had a strong passion for their major and loved to collaborate with others. Positive energy is super contagious. And I owe a lot of my growth and accomplishments to the people who have inspired me. And that includes you all, so thank you!\n\nMy second thought comes from my comparing my ugrad app experience vs my grad app experience. I had a really scattered ugrad app, ngl. When looking at my past profile it's hard to pinpoint a smooth progression of how my passion for a specific major developed through my involvement in ECs, specific classes, projects, etc. It seemed as if I were crafting my profile and narrative first, then doing what I'd planned, with the intention of success. I had paved the way for myself before I'd done anything. Sure, I ended up enjoying these activities/clubs, but they didn't really contribute to the development of my academic passions. Thus, I struggled a lot with ugrad essays.\n\nHowever, during ugrad, perhaps it was the fact that I hadn't planned to go to grad school that gave me time to consider what impact I wanted to have on others. Thus, I took on opportunities based on technical interest as well as the impact they have on things I cared about. And low and behold, it was the experiences I had and the people I've interacted with that gave me the next step in my journey. As a result, when I did realize I wanted to do grad school, it was SO MUCH EASIER to document my progression towards pursuing ECE, and I knew exactly how certain events catalyzed other events/decisions in my life. So words of wisdom to anyone, let your experiences be catalysts for your journey because life isn't deterministic (unless u wanna get really philosophical, then we can discuss lol)\n\nLast reflection is more geared toward ppl who are considering applying to grad school. Apply for the right reason. Grad school is not some temporary safe haven to escape the harsh reality of the job market, nor is it (maybe an unpopular opinion) an opportunity we leverage to solely get a better chance at finding a job post-grad or getting a higher salary. (Of course, it's important to note that certain majors like medicine or law kind of require some sort of post-undergrad schooling, so there are exceptions)\n\nSure, getting a Masters's or PhD oftentimes come with higher salaries or better job prospects. But if you lack excitement or passion to learn in the program u apply to and don't care about research in your concentration, then it'd be pretty dang hard to genuinely express why you wanna get another degree. Paying extra money to avoid what's inevitable creates more debt. Unlike ugrad essays, where the common app can be reused for different schools, grad apps are personalized to each uni, and we get pages to write our personal statements and SOPs.\n\nAll this is to say, you can be successful regardless of where you're currently positioned. And don't let societal standards or fear limit your options or make your life some deterministic model. We aren't machines. And don't be afraid to be proactive with friendships, ppl find it extremely admirable if you take the first initiative. And last, best of luck with grad apps and beyond. Thank you for letting me share all my thoughts. And wish everyone on this forum a wonderful start to spring!\n\nPS. If anyone is curious, I'll be committing to CMU!"

    "body": "\n\nHi!! Apologies for the random post but I really need some input from those who have been there done that. Because I’m really stressing.\n\nBasically, I am a senior in college majoring in computer science. I graduate and leave campus for good in… well, pretty much two months, give or take a couple weeks. I’m trying to just keep my head down and stay focused on submitting my thesis and passing classes but the unknown of- well, everything- after college is REALLY getting to me. As in I can’t even sleep without having nightmares.\n\nMy biggest thing is being scared of being all on my own. I never had such an open ended ‘what now?’ Feeling. High school I knew I was going to college. But now I have no idea. I’ve tried applying for internships and research cohorts for the summer but haven’t heard back (yet? Hopefully). That’s my first hurdle- surviving in a job market that I’m graduating at a horrible time for. I’ve heard so many stories about it being SO hard to get even a basic job, let alone one in my field. I worry if it comes down to it and I can’t secure a job (summer or otherwise) I’ll have to give up on forming my own independence and have to live with my parents who I love, but are incredibly toxic to live with. I really want to avoid that at all costs.\n\nThe other big issue is my roommate right now. We are SUPER close, as in a weird more than best friends but not dating (we are both lgbtq so it’s more of a lavender couple if anything lol). I’m a very stability focused person and he is big on keeping options open. I’m terrified that our plan to get an apartment with each other in November will fall through if he decides he doesn’t want to be around me for whatever reason. Obviously the answer would be ‘okay??? Find another roommate or live alone and get over it’ but while I’ve gotten over most of my anxious attachment issues I think it would be REALLY terrifying for me to go from having my friends as my support system and then all of a sudden being just… me. So I really hope he will at least be the one consistent thing but I know I can’t guarantee that. He could get zapped by lightning tomorrow! And I definitely (with or without him) want to not just follow him around and make friends with his friends, but actually work on being confident and finding my own people.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the ramble but does anyone have advice on how to keep going even when everything is SO uncertain? Because going through my day with constant stress headaches and nightmares is NOT it fr"

    "body": "Hi, y'all! Maybe you've seen my other recent posts, but I feel like there's a lot of misconceptions about interviewing in regards to college and scholarship interviewing. I've spent hundreds of hours learning about the art of the interview (because I love talking lol), and these are some my biggest points. I know I was SO lost last year, so hopefully I can help some people this year.\n\nFor reference, I went on approximately 20 interviews, with 8 of them being for colleges (Tufts, Washington and Lee, Duke, UPenn, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Harvard), and 12 of them being for scholarships/specialty programs (Alabama WUFP, Randall Research Scholars, Science Research Fellows for Baylor, Brown Foundation A&M, E2EnMed TAMU, 40 Acres Scholars (semifinalist and finalist interview), Johnson Scholar W&L, Principal's Scholarship, other scholarships).\n\nOverall, I went 5/8 for colleges and 12/12 for programs/scholarships for ones I interviewed for, and while this could be luck, I think it can be reasonably assumed that interviewing had something to do with it.\n\nOkay, so first things first:\n\nGeneric college interviews are not THAT important. Many colleges offer interviews to nearly every applicant, and interviews are often just a way to make alumni feel more connected to the school. However, they do play a  small role, often in distinguishing very similar applicants. And with 90,000 applicants, chances are, there will be another applicant that looks just like you on paper. Thus, interviews are still important! \n\nSo, if you are ever offered an interview, TAKE IT. You can reject interviews, but from admissions officers I've talked to, it's somewhat of a red flag because it means you're not even interested in taking time to learn about the school. I know plenty of people will say, Oh, I never signed up for an interview/turned it down and got in -- good for you! But it honestly can't hurt.\n\nSecondly, use the college interviews as a chance to LEARN more about the college. Don't lose sight of the fact that you're talking with an alumnus. \n\nNow regarding program interviews, here, the interview is crucial! It's the differentiating factor between you and everybody else, and many programs base their final decision solely on the interview. Thus, you should absolutely take these as seriously as possible.\n\nOkay, with that out of the way, here are my tips for both general-purpose college interviews and specific scholarship/program interviews. It's a general flowchart you should follow\n\n* Do your research\n   * Go in with general knowledge about the program, the alumnus you're talking to (general info, like class year, their job, etc is good), and of course, specific knowledge about why you want this opportunity\n      * It is incredibly easy to tell if an interviewee is unprepared. I went in for an engineering scholarship and started talking about neuroscience, and they just straight up declined me on the spot lol\n   * This doesn't mean spending hours stalking people on LinkedIn or obsessing over every paper published by a specific program. I think 1-2 hours is good enough preparation for interviews, especially on a busy high school schedule.\n      * What I like to do is go in with three specific questions that can't be answered with a quick Google (more on this later)\n      * Also have in your back pocket some tidbits about the program of interest that the interviewer DOESN'T know. At all of my interviews, from Tufts to Princeton to Yale to Harvard, I was able to TEACH the interviewer something about their school. I'll touch on this later, but this sort of dedication is really impressive. Picture it this way, if a middle schooler wants to come to your high school, and they tell you about a club you didn't know about, wouldn't you think more highly of that kid?\n* Dress well\n   * College interviews have a habit of saying, \"Wear whatever's comfortable.\" I tend to disagree -- a suit (and a tie, if you have it), or equivalent fancy wear will never lead you astray. Not only do you come across as much more confident and knowledgeable (multiple studies confirm this), it's also a visual reminder to you to take it more seriously than you might otherwise.\n      * Since it's August, and interview season hasn't started yet, I would invest in a good blue and black suit (blue is slightly less formal, more expressive). They can be quite cheap (especially from warehouses/factory stores), and you'll never regret having that as a clothing option.\n* Thank the interviewer for their time\n   * Before you start, thank the interviewer. They took time out of their incredibly busy schedules to come here and listen to a high schooler yap about a college they want to go to. They deserve a little thanks.\n* Compliment the interviewer\n   * 90% of a person's impression of you is their first five minutes and the last five minutes. Start off strong with a targeted (yet not creepy) compliment, such as about the watch they're wearing.\n* Smile\n   * THIS ONE\n      * You need to always smile more than you think. People have a habit of a resting frown when they're interviewing (understandable because of the pressure), but smiling visually communicates to the interviewer that you are interested in what they're saying. Also, being around a happy person makes you 25% more likely to be happy, so you're making the interviewer happier, and thus, they'll look upon you more favorably.\n* Maintain eye contact\n   * I believe the rule is look at the person who's speaking 70% of the time. Eye contact signals that you're listening and attentive, and it's also a good way to show respect and deference.\n* Talk slower than you think you should\n   * People have a habit of speeding up and jumbling their words together when they interview because your heart is racing. Slow down--it's not a race. Take a deep breath, and collect yourself. Don't be afraid to start your sentence over or apologize. At the end of the day, you're 17/18. It's okay to make mistakes.\n* Take a second before answering\n   * Usually, the interviews start off with them asking you questions. After they say the question, wait a beat, then respond. I usually like to say, \"That's a really good question.\" This buys me a couple seconds before answering, which I can use to formulate my response. Starting immediately after they finish makes it seem like you're dying to talk and cut them off (bad), but also the advice of taking as long as you want to think of an answer can often fall flat. Taking 30 seconds for a question (especially if it's not a curveball) can signal disinterest and lack of preparedness. You never want to make your interviewer wait or feel like they're having to extract answers out of you. \n   * Reformulate the question as a lead in to your answer (buys you more time)\n* Come in with your story of who you \"are\"\n   * Have a general idea of who you want to present to the interviewer. You don't have to (and shouldn't) plan out an answer to every single possible question, but rather formulate a broad personality you want to present. For example, \"I'm a humanities major who has been shaped by the diverse environment in which I grew up.\" Or, \"I fell in love with robotics because it might one day allow my brother to walk again.\"\n      * These help structure your responses to your questions and ensure you're not straying too far off subject with meaningless or irrelevant facts about your life.\n* Tell some jokes (at your expense)\n   * Make fun of yourself :) These interviewers are so bored talking to a hundred kids who are all super smart. Make yourself memorable by telling some jokes. You get to distinguish yourself from other applicants while making the interview far more enjoyable for the interviewer. If you have them laughing, you have them listening.\n* Think on the fly\n   * This is the hardest part of the interview. It's the make-or-break quality. Often, some of the smartest people I know lack this skill because it's just not trained. To practice, get a friend/family member to ask you college interview type questions. Give your best answer, learn what you did wrong. And practice. Again. And again. \n* ASK QUESTIONS\n   * Incredibly important. Usually, at the end of the interview, there is time for you to ask questions. Always try to ask 2-3. Not only does it show interest, but people are happiest when they're talking about themselves -- give your interviewer a chance to be happy. This is also a way to learn more about the school/program. And since ending impressions are super important, this leaves the interviewer walking away going, \"Wow, that kid seemed interested.\"\n      * If your mind is blank, and you can't think of a single question, ask my favorite question of, \"In your opinion, what about this \\[school/program\\] makes it so distinctive and singular?\"\n* Shake the interviewer's hand (or go in for a hug if you're confident)\n   * Self-explanatory\n* Send a follow-up email a couple days later thanking them for their time.\n\nFor multi-person interviews, the process is the same. Just split your eye contact across multiple people, ask different people questions, and smile even more (because it's scary).\n\nHope you enjoyed this. If you did, lmk! If you have any questions, also lmk! I'd be happy to answer!"

As I continue into my first year of graduate school, I have been thinking back to my undergraduate years and how lost/confused I was when navigating schools. So, with my past four years, I am going to put my tips and tricks to surviving college! This will be split into three sections: Dormitory/Housing, Academics, and finances. You can feel free to add in, agree, or disagree! This has been my experience, but I know there are many out there with different experiences. Enjoy! \n\nPrior to starting, I feel the need to add this in. Community college is something that is debated a lot, and if I were to go back five years ago (putting athletics aside and purely financial), I would have absolutely taken the route to community college. Financially, it is the smartest option (in my opinion); for those who are able to, staying up at home and saving money off of rent/housing/meal plans is absolutely amazing. Yes, there might be limitations in the classes at community colleges, but the fact that you are getting a degree AT ALL is amazing! There is no shame in community college, and it really is an amazing avenue for anyone looking to get a degree. Of course, there are limitations in regard to the types of classes and degrees offered, but community colleges, as a whole, are financially highly recommended and once you get your degree, you can choose to transfer to a larger college if you wish.\nAhem, anyways. Let’s get on to it! \n\n**MAJOR DISCLAIMER: This post is too long, so part 2 will be in the comments (or an entirely different post depending on length)**\n\n**Disclaimer: There will be a few cusses in here, but they will be censored.

I am not sponsored by anything, so please no company sue me or that’d really suck.** \n\n \n\nDormitory/Housing: Ah, so you finally made it to college! No more mom, no more siblings, no more curfew, just you and the REAL world! You’re a little nervous, but that’s alright! Everyone else is as scared/nervous as you are! You go through orientation (God that took so many hours, right?!), and everything sounds absolutely amazing. Plus, you got a bunch of free t-shirts, bags, and cups. However, as you make your way to your empty dorm, you can’t help feeling doubt clouding your mind. Totally cool. Let’s go through a couple questions and recommendations that I have for a wide variety of people! \n\n \n\n**1.** You are super excited to get into your room and start decorating! You have been waiting for this since you were fourteen (or even younger). The world is your oyster, you have Pinterest boards, written writeups, and you and your roommate are ready to take on the world. Well, except you realize that buying these decorations is really f-ing expensive. You got to target, and oh my goodness a single plush throw is THIRTY-FIVE FLIPPING DOLLARS. You have five hundred dollars in your back account and a dream (if even that)! Everyone is always saying how Target is so affordable, but for me, I have found it to be the biggest scam. They charge you a lot for what is supposed to be actually affordable. However, don’t you worry, I got some tricks for you! \n\nOkay OP, so where am I supposed to go? Target? Walmart? The thrift store? Well, believe it or not, you can shop at Target and Walmart, and I have a few links to where you can find affordable items for those stores with different items. But I have a few better spots that are more financially friendly for college students. \n\nThe first spot(s) are TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. I know I know; you can walk into one of these places and leave with 400$ worth of stuff in a blink. However, when it comes to getting small things such as: bedding, blankets, rugs, and tubber ware, I find these sister stores to be a god send. I have gotten nearly all my towels from HomeGoods.  \n\nGood towels can go for 10$ which can be pricey, but there is a deal at HomeGoods (or sometimes Tj Maxx) where they have a set of towels (Rachel Zoe, Tahari, Ecotery, etc.) that include: two bath towels, two wash clothes, and two hand towels for 24.99$. Y’all, you don’t need forty-seven towels, I have five bath towels I rotate and three towel turbans that I use for my hair. You can reuse your towels (cleaning them of course). The reason I say to go to Tj Maxx of HomeGoods is because a Rachel Zoe towel set can run you 50 + dollars easily. Of course, if you don’t want a towel set, you can get individual towels from 6.99-12.99. But, as I say, that is a pretty penny. I suggest these sets, however, there are other stores that offer similar options! Those include target, Walmart, bed bath and beyond, and Khol’s (just to name a few!). I have a few options at the bottom of this entire thing! The only downside for TJ Maxx and HomeGoods is their website is pretty bad, so I would recommend going in person. \n\nOkay, so towels! Damn you can go on a long time about towels. What about bedding? Rugs? And all that other jazz? HomeGoods is my go-to for bedding, entirely so. You can get good sheets sets for 19.99 and blankets for 14.99 and on. I prefer to not use a comforter and just drown in over the size throws. In addition to HomeGoods, you can also try Ross, where I found a bunch of similar things for the same prices so and so. Links will be listed below for sheets and blankets. \n\nImportant note! You, yes you. I am talking to you. Some folks don’t know this, but it is recommended to clean your bedding every two weeks. It can be a hassle, especially if you want to do nothing but sleep, but if you want to feel clean in the morning and after a shower: clean your bed sheets and blankets. I do so every two weeks, and some folks might scream, but I put my sheets in the washer and dryer and just run it either hot or warm water. For blankets, I tend to do a warm setting, and I always always always do heavy load setting. Get that filth out. You and your roommate will thank you for cleaning your bed sheets. \n\n**Tip 1**: I recommend having two to three sets of bed sheets; yes, you heard me right. I have two “good” sets of bed sheets that I switch on and off while cleaning the others. I then have one kind of mid set of bed sheets that I use for “if only I am too lazy to clean the others one”. It makes life a helluva lot easier if you don’t feel like washing your bed sheets, so you can just pop the new ones on and put the other ones to be washed later on. \n\n**Tip 2**: Because this doesn’t fit with the above, I recommend using queen or even king-sized bed sheets (I use queen). The reason being that there is nothing I hate more than waking up with my bed sheets coming off of my mattress and sleeping on an icky mattress pad or mattress. Having queen or king sets, you don’t have to worry about that as much. \n\nThe second spots I like for decorating purposes are: five below, dollar tree, dollar general, and Target/Walmart 1,3, and 5$ shops. Now now, I know what y’all are thinking: didn’t OP just bash target and Walmart? Yes, I absolutely did. Just hear me out. I know, like me, y’all likely want some rad lights, calendars, clocks, etc. But then you go to a normal place and a set of string lights are 15-30$. Like, my brother in love, what??? My favorite spot to go for cool nick knacks is 5 below. You can find a bunch of room decorations in that store, from lights, calendars, clocks, random decorations, etc. Listen, if it’s for decoration, it doesn’t need to be super expensive. Additionally, dollar tree and dollar general are also adequate for said decorations. I just found five below and Tj Maxx/HomeGoods to be the easiest for decorations. \n\nOkay, now you’re probably like: OP what about the whole Target Walmart thing? Well, you see, this is my one tidbit about these two dudes. There is a section y’all see with these two which are the 5$ and below section. These are tailored specifically for college students (and those of us who definitely are not responsible with money), and you can find a lot of neat (small) decorations for cheap! Just be careful how much you add to cart cause that can get expensive.  \n\nThe third spots I like for general laundry detergent, lights, batteries, soaps, etc. are discount stores. Not sure exactly what’s around y’all but where I am we have an Ollie’s bargain store. It is a little bit overwhelming, but with a few deep breaths, you can find main brand laundry detergent, dryer sheets, soaps, cleaning supplies, etc. It will be expensive anywhere to get these cleaning and basic supplies, but I find that bargain stores are your best bet for trying to save any money at all.  \n\n \n\n \n\n**2.** Now you’re probably thinking: holy f\\*ck OP we get it, you like shopping and have probably spent an ungodly amount of money on blankets. Yes, you’re absolutely right. I have. And do I regret it? No. Does my bank account regret it? Yes. So, let’s get along with dorm life recommendations.  \n\nOkay, OP, I have read this far: what should I know about laundry? Well, my friend, I am glad you have asked. You see, your school has likely done the thing where they stuff a bunch of people in one dorm and have given them 2 washers and dryers for 100+ people. And suddenly, it’s Sunday afternoon and you realize you have no clean clothes, and when you try to go to the laundry room, there are people hogging the washers and driers. Oh, and you go to grab your laundry from the drier (literally a minute after it ends) and you catch someone taking your stuff out and putting theirs in. Like, yeahhhhh, no.  \n\nMy recommendation for this conundrum is a bit unusual. Some might like it, some might not. So, when my weekends come around, I know lots of folks will have gone home, out partying, watching football, etc. For boring people like me, I do some of that stuff. However, in the late evenings (and I mean 12 – 4am) I like to do my laundry. No one is here or awake, and no one is certainly worrying about laundry when they can be getting wasted at a bar somewhere. Guess when I wrote this entire thing? Yep, 2:30am doing my laundry. You don’t have to worry about folks stealing your laundry, you don’t have to worry about having enough washers and driers.  \n\nThe downside to this method? You have to be a night owl. You have to be willing to suck it up and be up at the ungodly hours. If you’re like me, you’ll probably be doing a research project, scrolling through reddit, or watching football (I don’t have much of a social life let’s be for real). So, I get the apprehension. If you want a more reasonable time, then you can likely do it earlier in the morning (8am – 10am) when folks are getting ready for lectures. There’s a better chance you can get washers and driers. If you have a day where you have nothing to do, then I recommend the night before getting your washing and cleaning done, that way you can crash without consequences when you are done. \n\nThanks for the tips OP, but how do I even wash my laundry? So, I am not the best person to ask for this. Personally, what I found has worked for me, is putting all my colors together and then all my whites together (I do not promote racism; I am talking about clothes, people). I always wash on hot, heavy load, and normal settings. I want my clothes cleaned, y’all. I don’t care what the labels say (unless what I am washing is expensive). Additionally, I always dry my clothes hot or warm (depending on the material). If it’s expensive, it’s probably air dry or no heat, I would recommend doing that varying on directions.  \n\nOkay, but what about even loading the washer and drier? A common question for those of us who haven’t really done laundry before. You know what’s embarrassing? When you overload the washer and suddenly there is water all over the floor and a washer out of commission for an entire dorm. Then suddenly you get an email to everyone from your RA telling them to NOT OVERFILL THE WASHERS. Couldn’t be me (shivers). So, what do we take from this? It is going to be annoying, but you cannot fill the washer to the rim. Firstly, your sh\\*t won’t get cleaned, and secondly there’s a good chance you will overflow the washer. I fill the washers just over halfway and run my cycle. \n\nThen there is washing detergent and all that fancy stuff. Before even loading my laundry, I put one pod in of laundry detergent and then a whole cup of the smelling stuff (idk what it is called). If you are an athlete, I recommend doing two cups of laundry smelling scent stuff. Also, if you are an athlete, you need to wash your clothes regularly. I know I should not be the one telling you this, but it is better that I tell you this than your roommate or RA.  \n\n \n\n \n\n**3.** Okay, OP thanks for the lecture about laundry (you probably). But what about my roommate? What if I am anti-social as f\\*ck? Well, to be honest, if you’re on reddit, then you got your answer. No, I am just f\\*cking with you. College is a scary place, especially if you’re introverted. Your parents, like mine, probably have said “this is your place to reinvent yourself”, thanks mom and dad. And while you probably think your parents are trying to just have your back, they are actually right. This is something I haven’t done particularly well since going to my new graduate school. It is scary, man. Especially coming in with completely different people, and (if like me) from a completely different part of the country.  \n\nOkay, so what do I do? For me, I play on a sports team. I have found that consistently interacting with these people has given me a social outlet, and we all bond together over something we are passionate about. You are going to have a bunch of different people in one place focusing on the same goal. Yet, it does not just have to be a sport. It can be a club, it can be a football fantasy league, it can be a meet up with a group of people for a club named “socializing 101”. Listen, college is scary. You need to meet your groups of people; that is something I am still learning myself. You don’t need to get stupid drunk to meet folks, you don’t have to change yourself. Finding people in your classes is crucial, try to make study groups. Sometimes, you have to just approach a person and ask them if you can have lunch, talk about school, or something. It’s scary as hell, but that is one way I made genuine friends.  \n\nWhat if I am unsure about my roommate? Oh buddy, let me tell you, I have horror stories about roommates. You have heard stories about roommates. Your 3^(rd) great uncle Joe has horror stories about roommates. We ALL do. Realistically, when going to college and knowing no one, it is super difficult to find a roommate randomly that you f\\*ck with. What I highly recommend is taking that charting thing FR. Talk to these folks, get to know them. And if you get there and y’all hit it off like two peas in a pod? Hell yeah.  \n\nHowever, if you get there and you KNOW it ain’t gonna last longer than Aaron Rodger’s Achilles last season, then what I recommend is talking with your roommate about possible issues that they have and how you can sort them out. If that don’t work, talk to your RA. They don’t get paid enough to deal with that, but they will try their best to sort it out. They’re human, so please be nice to them. And if that does not work, approach the housing resource station (or whatever it is called) and ask them to switch. Explain the situation to them, that you have talked with the RA, and that it is just not going to work. There’s a good chance you will ruin someone’s year with that e-mail that the open spot in their dorm room has been taken over, but there is a 90% chance it will be better than before. And, if you’re lucky, they might have room for a double that is unoccupied.  \n\nIf all else fails and you know you will be miserable with anyone, then I would recommend doing the scary thing and looking into a single. It will be more expensive, that is factual. But, if you’re like me and genuinely cannot have a roommate due to medical issues, then looking into a single is important. It might be worth more, but it also comes with peace of mind. If you know that you will struggle having a roommate no matter who you live with that is a sign that this might be the right path for you. \n\n**Tip 1**: If you have a disability that can be supported by doctor note/diagnosis, reach out to the ADA department at your school and there is a chance they can put you in ADA housing. This is almost always a single for those who have a disability. It can be a struggle to go through, but it is one of the ways that those with disabilities can get the housing appropriate for them. \n\n\\*\\*Tip 2\\*\\*: Do not miss out on room selection. It may be at 6am in the morning on a random Tuesday, but if you miss out on signing up for a good dorm or put on the lottery, you will hate yourself. Have a plan. You need to have a plan; someone you want to have a room with (or a plan for a single you want) and be ready to go to war. Folks will be refreshing wanting that one golden dorm. If you are even an hour late (overexaggerating for some colleges), then you are getting the worst dormitory in the school (the one where the only two toilets on the floor are always clogged or out of order and the community kitchen is always gross and being used). So be prepared.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\\*\\*4\\*\\*. Okay, so: buying stuff, laundry, and roommates, that’s great and all, but here are a few miscellaneous things that don’t really fit with the rest. First thing first, I’m gonna lecture you on bedtimes, routines, and all that. If your parents haven’t done it, I am going to. Unlike me (it is currently just past 3am now), you need to have steady bedtime. It is not elementary school, but you need to have a bedtime you try to stick to. For me, I have work in the mornings, so I am typically going to bed around 12am and waking up at 7am. Except you, my child, needs to be sleeping 7 to 9 hours a day. Sleep is crucial to learning, surviving, and all that jazz. Don’t trust me? Take it from Cornell, UNC, even the freaking CDC. You can probably survive at 4, 5, or 6 hours. But do I recommend it? No. Not only will your learning retention be shortened, but you will feel like shit. It does not matter how much coffee you get or how many sodas you down, you need your damn sleep.  \n\nOP I need to study though? And I have sports? Like, what do you expect of me? I get it, as a STEM major and college athlete, getting sleep is ridiculously difficult. What you need to do is have a plan. You need to plan out your assignments, you need to stick to a studying schedule, and you need to stick to a routine. It is so easy to get carried away at 2am watching videos on how to build a fortress out of toothpicks. We have all been there. But then you have to be to practice at 6am and suddenly you can’t fall asleep for the life of you. Then it is 330am and you get a little bit of sleep and then BEEP BEEP BEEP, your five something am alarm is going off. At that point, was it even worth getting sleep?  \n\nSo, in short, you have to work in a routine. Find one you can work with, whether it is going to bed at 9pm or 1am. Yes, I said 1am. If you can at least be steady and work in a system that you are used to, then you can learn to deal with the schedule presented to you.  \n\nSo now you’re probably thinking about the lecture I just gave you. What about down time? Like, seriously OP, when am I supposed to even have time to myself? That’s the thing, college is supposed to be amazing, and you have all this down time. And you tell yourself “I just survived high school that went on for 8+ hours a day this is nothing,” but if you tell yourself that then you are falling into a trap. Listen, we all survived high school (or some sort of prior education), and it is unbelievably easy to think that with so much time on your hands, you can do anything you want. And I mean anything.  \n\nYour studies are important; some people put all their time into their academics and all the power to them. Some of them are athletes, and they find themselves struggling to balance academics and athletics, which is also valid. And some of us have managed to figure it all out by managing to keep it up for 32 hours a day and have no problem. No seriously, we all know a person like that. \n\nIn reality, despite college appearing to be an open door to free time, you really need to be careful. Go to your damn classes, eat properly, attend social meetings, study, and then set aside 1 – 3 hours to yourself. This can be in the evening; this can be spread out over the day. Just take some time, listen to music, work out, walk, nap, do something to help clear your mind out. If you don’t, then you are going to go crazy. I would know it, believe me, I have been there and done that.  \n\n \n\n\\*\\*Lastly\\*\\*: relationships. Okay, we are ready, what do we really know about love? If you read this, you’re kidding yourself, we are on reddit y'all. No, I am playing (cries in forever alone). So, you have arrived at college, you’re going to class and see the prettiest or most handsome guy, gal, or pal you’ve ever seen. You are flabbergasted wondering how such an attractive person is in front of you. And, like a dream, they approach you, y’all strike up a conversation, and two months later you are engaged. Listen, I am all for relationships, find your person. However, do not rush into marriage, especially as a freshman. You’re still learning people; you're still learning who you are. The girl you’re seeing? That’s actually the football captain’s sister, and he is an angry linebacker while you’re a 5’9 tight-end. AKA, unless you get to know her, make sure you don’t rush into anything.  \n\nOf course you don’t need me, a redditor, to lecture you. You are your own person. But I just really want you to consider not rushing into anything without knowing the person. I am not saying to not get into a relationship, just make sure you like the person for who they are and not for the thrill of being in a relationship.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\\*\\*Academics\\*\\*: Well well well, you’ve managed to get past housing/dorms. You have your courses set up, class times ready, and a dream to get that 4.0. Woo! Exciting! Here’s how you can get those good grades. I, personally, was a 3.3 student in my undergraduate (B- to A student). So, take my advice with a grain of salt. The general things that will be covered here are: realism, coursework, and so on. \n\n \n\n\\*\\*1\\*\\*. I want that 4.0! How do I do it? Well, hello there! You’re here and you’re in class. You get to your class fifteen minutes early, seeing the rest of the fresh faces who are also attending that class. You enter into the lecture room, take a seat close to the professor but not front row so you don’t get picked on. You do this four or five more times and after the end of the first week you think that you got the hang of it. Well that, my friends, is called the syllabus week.  \n\nYou either have three types of classes: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (each 50 min), Tuesday and Thursday (hour and fifteen minutes), or one day a week for three hours. I personally don’t mind any of these besides the three hour one. Why is that, you may ask. It’s only once a week! How hard can that be? And you will ask yourself that when you are an hour and a half in with a lecture talking about different types of cell mechanics in sunflower seeds which you have no interest in because you’re an English major.  \n\nSo let me be realistic with y’all for a second, you can absolutely get a 4.0. Folks who do put a whole lot of heart and soul into what they do. For me? Once you get to upper-level courses (STEM major), suddenly those easy courses get real hard. You could get a 40 on an exam and be ecstatic because the second highest grade was a 22. It doesn’t matter how hard you study, at times, there are professors that will screw you over. This leads me to my very first tip (one you have likely heard before) which is: rate my professor. \n\nYou’ve heard, your mom has heard it, and remember your 3^(rd) great uncle joe? Yeah, he’s heard of it too. And this website is not just there to show you pretty numbers, when you are scheduling your classes, go to the f\\*ing websites and look at your professors. If they have a 1 star rating with 45 reviews, try to avoid that professor. Think of it was a food service. Do you really want to go to a professor with a 2 star rating with the average commentator saying that the professor puts questions on the test the range from who wrote Romeo and Julliet to how to do chi squared? Yeah, me neither. This leads in my next point and, if you are here, possible the most important thing I am going to say in this entire thread: \n\n\\*\\*MEETING WITH YOUR ADVICE EARLY AND REGISTER AS SOON AS CLASSES COME OUT.\\*\\*\n\nMy god, I can not scream this into the void enough. For me, I went to a smaller school, so I guess it would be easier to get advising appointments in. However, y’all, especially with classes that are lower level (which multiple folks in different majors have to take), you  need to be early with registration. Your advisor will you give you suggestions on classes and give you a schedule which is adequate for your time. It is your responsibility to make sure you have that lined up, with professors you like, and are ready to register (accept the class schedule) the minute it becomes available. I am telling you right now, every single person who can register early will register early. It is going to be another 7am it opens sort of thing (like with dorms), and if you are not there quick enough, you are going to be stuck with the Mr. Smith who is an ex-police officer “resigned” from duty for doing illegal activities and the only way he can get credit time served (a job) is to work at the college teaching you children about literature from the 1800s (he doesn’t even have a degree).  \n\nI mean this whole heartedly when I say do your f\\*cking researching. Your life will be so much easier if you put the effort in and ensure that you are ready to enroll as soon as it becomes available. If you don’t, you will hate yourself. Remember, rate my professor is like yelp for professors. Do you want a professor that I will go out of their way when a class doesn’t perform well on the test to go over questions for extra credit if everyone participates? Or do you want Mr.Smith who is teaching or else his ex-wife will sue him due to a few too many restraining order violations?  \n\n \n\n\\*\\*2\\*\\*. OP how do I even contact my professor? What if I am not doing well in class but they do not have office hours when I need it? My friend, let me tell you a quick story. It was my freshman year, and I was taking anatomy and physiology one. I was doing alright except for the practical(s). By alright I mean I was scraping with a 71 and a dream. I realized that if I dropped to a 70, I would fail that class. It’s my last module in that class and there is a good shot I don’t pass. So, what did I do? Did I A. ignore my problems and focus on studying for the next two weeks straight B. beg my professor for extra credit C. cheat on my exam with answers given from Mary Jane for 100$ in exchange or D. go to the professor and ask what to do? If you answered D, you would be correct. And you know what that professor did? He 1. helped me with some of the content I was not understanding and 2. recommended I go to the tutoring center. \n\nI, someone who had a 3.8 out of high school, suddenly was looking into ... tutoring. What blasphemy was this?! Except, it was not blasphemy. In fact, tutoring saved my grade not just in A&P 1, but it allowed me to understand the rest of the classes I was struggling with. For most of my undergraduate, I would schedule lessons with the tutoring center (twice a week per class I was struggling with), and we would go over details on what I had issues with, how to go about them differently, and why they were answered the way they were. \n\nMy teacher explained to me like this: going to a tutor who has taken the class with that professor before is like getting a cheat sheet for the exam. The tutors have to have maintained at least a 90 in that class within the past three years. All the tutors I went to had notes from those classes, past exam questions, and they could answer questions I had on homework. They didn’t have past exam copies, necessarily, but they were able to answer questions I had that regarded to possible test questions. You guys don’t know how helpful it is to ask a tutor what possible questions will be on the exam, and they explain it to you and then, look at it, those exact questions (with varying amounts) are on the exam!  \n\nThanks for the lecture, OP! But what if I can’t find a tutor in the subject I have? What if my class is upper level or there are no tutors that have the time availability for me? The thing I figured out as I was finishing my bachelor's degree is that you NEED to contact your teachers. Some may of office hours, but there is often the idea that if you can’t reach them during office hours, they won’t be able to get to you at all. Sometimes you might be able to make office hours; yet, if you can’t, you just have to reach out to your professor. Talk to them after class, make an email thread, do whatever you can to establish that you have questions and need help. Ask them if you can come in sometime other than office hours. I promise you that they will say yes, especially with upper-level professors. They are there to help you, and you have to be willing to reach out for that help.  \n\nOne class that I established a tutoring schedule with was with my Spanish professor. I started it in Spanish 2, and when I got to Spanish 4 I was doing relatively okay. However, despite my attempts to learn Spanish, I was still greatly at a disadvantage compared to my classmates. Why? I don’t know, I just sucked at Spanish. So, I reached out to this professor, and we made a tutoring schedule 2 –3 times a week for fifty minutes. We would go over the contents that I was struggling with and then the contents of the next lecture. This gave me a heads up on what we would be talking about that next day so I wouldn’t feel so nervous. We did our lectures entirely in Spanish, and let me tell you, I couldn’t understand a peep of what he said. But, with having the tutoring sessions in English (AND ACTUALLY COMMMUNICATING WITH MY PROFESSOR) I managed to get my first B in Spanish.  \n\nThis is one example. I have also had tutoring in parasitology (amazing professor but difficult class), genetics, A&P 2, and so on. Even now, in my graduate program, I have established connections with professors to ensure that I am doing the best I can to understand the materials. My classes are asynchronous, but I still reach out to my professors when I don’t understand something. We sit down and meet to discuss questions I have. And if you can’t find a time that works, talk to them. Leave an e-mail chain. SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. \n\nIt is best to do ANYTHING than struggle in silence. Professors do not what to see you fail, it’s their job to ensure that you are able to do the best you can. If there is one thing you take away from this post it is this: get tutoring if you don’t understand something, reach out to your professors directly. It is different in big schools, I get that. But the same thing applies to TAs and other tutoring centers, there are sources there to help you, you just have to admit that you need help.  \n\n\\*\\*Note\\*\\*: Y’all have heard the term “Cs get degrees”, and darling, guess what, that is true. Listen people associate with Cs by scraping by, and once you get to genetics and geriatric care, yeah, you’re gonna be a bit nervous and confused. Some folks are great at courses like that, some people study real hard and get those good grades. For folks like me who are average (maybe even a bit dumb) but try hard to get an average grade, good on you. Sometimes we have to realize that just because you got a C does not mean you are any lesser than someone who got higher. Y’all are both important and both passed. Some folks are super smart and work incredibly hard to get those grades, all the power to you guys. Me? Well, I worked incredibly hard and scraped by. It’s okay to not have the highest grade, as long as you are doing what you absolutely can, then all the power to you.  \n\n \n\n\\*\\*3\\*\\*. You wake up at 7am on Wednesday and look at your alarm clock knowing you have to be at lecture from 8 to 10. You dread it, and you can’t help but ponder why you waited to the last second to register and ended up with an 8am five days a week. You decide to skip the class; what’s the worst that happens? Well, some people can afford class. Some professors don’t take attendance. Yet, as you move up class levels and the class sizes get smaller, professors will start taking attendance. You can skip a certain number of classes before failing. Listen, you have your own willpower! It is your choice! Skip those classes!  \n\nNo, please don’t. I am completely serious when I say you need to attend your classes. You miss one class and suddenly you are completely lost. It’s one class, then two, then four, etc. It can fall apart so quickly. I am not saying you can’t skip one or two classes (hell, I have done the same). However, once you realize you are missing too many classes and your grades start to slip, when does it stop? You have to realize that missing classes will lead to consequences. This can be getting worst grades or even being dropped from the class. It is not worth it y’all. This is not something I will settle on; you need to attend your classes. You will regret it, I promise you.  \n\n \n\n\\*\\*4\\*\\*. You’ve seen this little website going around, it is said to make college life much easier. Just a little enter into the search bar and suddenly you have a whole essay or research product in seconds! You submit, surely thinking that it is better than anything you have ever written. You get it back and huh?! A zero! What is this mayhem! You just failed the class, and now you can never show your face to that professor ever again. \n\nYou know what I am talking about folks: chat GPT. Well not just chat GPT but other AI sources as well. Listen, AI can be an absolutely amazing source. But it is not an amazing source for writing essays and projects. I know it can be so tempting to just open that website and click that little button, all your worries \\*poof\\* gone. Suddenly there is the AI checker, no problem, you’ll try a different website that totally gets by the checker. Hahaha, no. You see, unlike the AI checker, your professor actually reads your essay. The AI checker might not detect AI, but your professor sure as hell will be able to smell the bull sh\\*t meter a mile away. Don’t believe me? I have seen students get dropped from classes for during in an AI generated project or essay. Your professors will not be pleased about this, I promise you. It showcases that 1. you don’t value their time and 2. that you don’t know the material (or can’t present that you do).  \n\nThis is not just chat GPT, as stated, there are other websites that offer these services in return for easy essays or projects. Guys, listen, just do your work. No magic AI center can convey understanding like a person. AI genuinely scares me. I know a lot of folks think AI is great, but I believe that there are limits to how good something can be. Once people start using AI to try and make it look like they understand concepts (that they don’t), then suddenly there are grades administered to people who don’t really understand topics. And while you can say “yay, I passed that class because of AI”, you realize that a lot of concepts build off of concepts that you used AI to look up. And, suddenly, AI really does not do a lot for you. \n\nI am not saying all AI is bad, in fact, there are two AI features I use in all my projects. That being scribbr and mybib. You see, one thing you will learn to do (a lot) is cite. You cite sources for EVERYTHING! And you know what I don’t want to do when I have been staring at a paper for the last eight hours and am all finished to realize that my sources are not cited yet? I do not want to f\\*ing cite fifteen sources manually. So, you know what I do? I pop my sources into scribbr or mybib and their AI will find the sites and cite it for you. It is not doing the project for you; it simply cites the site/source provided and gives you an accurate citation. I use these two for anything I needed citing for (MLA, APA, Vancouver, etc.), and it is the only AI I am really thankful for within my academic journey. Mybib and scribbr links will be at the bottom of this document for your availability. They require no sign up or fee. \n\n\\*\\*Note\\*\\*: Citation machine is also a good source! I find it to be a little more of a hassle with the ADs and sometimes not being able to get all the information when it is literally right there. However, it can still be a good way to cite if needed.  \n\n\\*\\*Note 2\\*\\*: You know what is important? Communication. Listen, we are talking about everything; communication is crucial for everything in your life. It starts with college, where it is your turn to take charge of your life. You are given freedom, but you also have to realize that you have responsibilities that come with those freedoms. There is no better time to start working in communication than college. It can be with professors, friends, team mates, room mates, and so on. One thing I have learnt in college is how to speak up for myself. I used to be quiet and very nervous to advocate for my well being. However, once you get to higher education, you realize that your parents, siblings, or Uncle Joe are going to advocate for you. They might for the first few months, but this is the part of your life where you realize your parents can’t be the ones speaking for you. The example I use is making phone calls.  \n\nSomething that is so easy yet so daunting. I remember in 9^(th) grade I had to miss a sports practice, and I had to call my captain but had a full-blown mental breakdown and started sobbing. I then called her (when practice was already over) telling them I would not be able to make it to practice. Yeah, not my finest moment. But now? Yeah, I get nervous to make phone calls. But if you don’t learn how to initiate communication, then it will haunt you for the rest of your life. Only YOU can stop forest fires – no wait, only YOU can initiate communication in order to make your life easier. I am not saying that your parents are to stop from helping in everything. Last month I called my mom because I couldn’t get my sickle cell documentation, and I was so fed up with EVERYTHING. I had spent 200$ on a test/labs when I knew I did not need them. I had waited in an urgent care for two and a half hours, searched through every documentation and email I had, and I STILL could not find the documentation. Calling my mom as a last resort, it took her fifteen minutes to get the documentation from an old pediatrician. It’s okay to have parents help you out, but you have to realize that you need to be the one to initiate communication (most times). Thank you mom, by the way.   \n\n"

    "body": "Title. I mean this sub is obviously American (or I guess USA) centric, but obviously universities and colleges exist in other countries too, and from those multiple ‘international’ student posts, obviously non-americans also browse/lurk this sub too. So why not share the applying process to college/uni in your own country?\n\n\n\nMy own example is Lithuania (uh, if any other Lithuanians read this and see something wrong, correct me in comments, since it WAS a decade since I finished my own studies lol).\n\n\n\nCollege/uni starts in September 1^(st), like in many other countries. There is no early applying. Universities are more ‘academic’, and are considered a higher education facility than a more ‘hands on’ college.\n\n\n\nThe final exams start in late May/early June. All 12^(th) grade highschoolers that want to study in uni/college MUST sit in the national lithuanian language, math and a third chosen subject exam. Almost all unis/colleges ask for 4 exams, so thats the average number that students take, but obviously depending on what major people want to study, people take more.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of majors – yeah, you kinda have that in mind from about 9^(th) grade when HS starts, since at that point you can drop/pick subjects and their A or B levels. You usualy take A levels if you intend to take exams in that thing, but it’s not like anybody stops you if you do that from B levels. Tho, why would you do that, but I guess some students only kick themselves in the but to study in their last year, so thats on you bud.\n\n\n\nEither way – your school exams get graded rather quickly, you know your results by July (again, this is lithuania and there arent that many 12^(th) graders). Then you log in to your provided national uni/college applying site, quickly put in your info, and start applying!\n\n\n\nScoring high on exams is obviously important (from 1-100) especialy those that carry the more weight later on (the 0,4’s). Its also because in Lithuania uni/colleges are...mostly free if you actualy pay attention in school and score good in exams. When you apply to uni/college people obviously aim for the fully funded spots, since there is a limited amount in a specific major (like only 16 spots in 25 class).\n\n\n\nDepending on uni/college, you can already see what type of competition score you need to have in order to get in to your wanted major/ and the uni/college itself. So like, to apply to university X you need to have minimum of score 5.4 (1-10 scale), and to college Z you need 4.2 for example. If you clear that, you then take a look at the major itself who also declares the minimum score needed for that specific program to even get in. Some programs are more easy to get in (eg. history) than others (medicine).\n\n\n\nThis is where the exam scores come in. Each major is divided in four parts, and carry their own weight, again on a 1-10 scale. Its divided in, 0,4, 0,2, 0,2 and 0,2. So for example medicine major could ask you for your biology exam (0,4), chemistry (0,2), math (0,2), and lithuanian (0,2), but since medicine is competitive and you want as high as score as possible you also probably take some other exams, to boost your score, instead on relying on your 12^(th) grade final school grades that you didint take exam for. For things like history major, you might need lithuanian (0,4), history (0,2), math OR cs (0,2) and fourth exam that wasnt your first, second or third exams. Again, thats why 4 exams are kinda mandatory. For these programs you dont ‘need’ to take more exams, but it wont hurt if you have more since it still boost your score.\n\n\n\nYou also get some scores if you won some national/international olympiads, or something else major like olympics, but again, its only like 1-2 points max, for the first place, and the wast majority of kids dont have that.\n\n\n\nTho dont worry if you didint get into a fully funded spot – there are yearly rotations and people who study bad/dont go to lessons, so they can loose that spot, witch will be given to the best student in a non-funded spot. That or uni just gets more funding and a spot opens. That or simply you just study really good, and at least half your studies get compensated and returned to you. The last one happened to me lol. Also this is lithuania and while the prices are rising in the non-funded spots, its nothing too bad in a grand scheme of things. If you’re an orphan or poor, yeah, 99% you get free ride.\n\n\n\nBtw remember that national applying website? Yeah, when the results come in you can actually see your future peers scores, obviously no names. So you can see exactly what person/points were the cutoff line between the funded and not funded scores. \\*\\* **flashbacks of me not getting into the funded spot by 0,3 than the funded person** \\*\\*\n\n\n\nEither way, you get enrolled by August. You can decline if you want to and try enrolling somewhere else, but you better be quick, since again, September is almost there.\n\n\n\nObviously im not mentioning arts/music majors since they have their own systems/entrance exams with their portfolios and live performances.\n\n\n\nAlso, writing essays for applying? Dont know her. Extracurriculars? I mean these are hobbies, in the end of the day and in no way apply to applying to unis/colleges lol\n\n\n\nAaand ramble done. ask questions, I’ll try to answer them. Also waiting for others replies!"

In fact, researchers have found that in acquaintance rape--[one of the most common types of rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape)--[perpetrators tend to see their behavior as seduction, not rape, or they somehow believe the rape justified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape#Motivations).  \n\n\nYet [sexual assault is a tractable problem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4660251/). Offenders often [rationalize their behavior](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3053901.pdf?casa_token=UuYDZaA8LCIAAAAA:HnHjgy9A4thcjrpWDunYAu1Bea3xepmkYCxoA1EPgc5X5cer7cvxOF1xxo6WMenj6bDqYrlXUZ5UkNrWt-vVubhKpsIN47pN0zlIEFbCk-cMx3GCgSQZ) by whether society will let them get away with it, and the more the rest us confidently understand consent the better [advocates](https://www.ted.com/talks/jackson_katz_violence_against_women_it_s_a_men_s_issue) we can be for what's right. And yes, a little knowledge [can actually reduce the incidence of sexual violence](https://www.cdc.gov/violence-prevention/media/pdf/resources-for-action/SV-Prevention-Resource_508.pdf). \n\nSo, without further ado, the following are common misconceptions about sexual consent: \n\n* **[An overwhelming majority of people require *explicit*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20620316.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A35795183e914dfef5bad76292e6e685f) (i.e. [unambiguous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/explicit)) consent for any sexual activity beyond kissing in a new relationship**. However, [even an unwanted kiss can be fatal if the person being advanced upon feels unsafe due to a large discrepancy in size/strength](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gay-panic-austin-james-miller-texas-man-cleared-murder-a8327261.html).   \n\n* [**\"Token resistance\" to sex is virtually nonexistent, particularly for first encounters**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1998.tb00167.x). The overwhelming majority of men and women who say no to sexual advances really do mean no. It's **never** reasonable to assume that when someone says no, they don't really mean it (unless you have previously mutually agreed to role-play and have decided on an alternative safe word, in which case it's not an assumption) [even if the person has sent extremely \"mixed signals,\"](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260517699948) or even [engaged in some sexual contact](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent) ([as many sexual offenses often entail](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4484276/)).\n\n* [As in other social interactions, **sexual rejections typically are communicated with softened language**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957926599010003002) (\"Next time,\" \"Let's just chill,\" \"I really like you, but...\") [**and often don't even include the word \"no.\"**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957926599010003002) These rejections [are still rejections](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Montana&group=9), and any subsequent sexual activity [is still sexual assault](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Nebraska&group=9). Both men and women [are capable of understanding these types of refusals, and to pretend otherwise is disengenuous](https://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/mythcommunication-its-not-that-they-dont-understand-they-just-dont-like-the-answer/). Perpetrators often [misrepresent their own actions to garner support, avoid responsibility, blame the victim, and conceal their activities](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957926504045031), and [re-labeling sexual assault or rape as a \"miscommunication\" accomplishes those goals](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/casp.922). It may not be a good idea to recommend to someone that they try to communicate more forcefully, because [like domestic abusers, rapists often feel provoked by blows to their self-esteem](http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/papers/baumeistersmartboden1996[1].pdf), so encouraging someone to communicate in ways [that are considered rude](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/GEN144/um/KITZINGER_FRITH_Just_Say_No.pdf) could actually lead them to danger. Sex offenders are [more likely to be physically violent](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/repeat-rape-and-multiple-offending-among-undetected-rapists), and [1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men has experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner](https://share.google/images/WaZUMLBoD5GDlM7QI), so it is far from outrageous to take precautions against physical violence by being polite. \n\n* **[Most young women expect words to be involved](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2013.792326?casa_token=EvcYyZ5wHMoAAAAA:dsFZmPGUwuWaYaxrVaBUH9bjVhBME7yrtlbanwrHGets8BlHVJ-RcDN0woR_ozbe4ruQexK0sItoDw) when their partner seeks their consent**. [61% of men think verbal consent is a must before sex](https://www.deseret.com/2018/11/28/20659580/do-you-need-verbal-consent-for-holding-hands-kissing-sex-the-differences-between-men-and-women-may-s/). Overall, verbal indicators of consent or nonconsent [are more common than nonverbal indicators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322). More open communication also [increases the likelihood of orgasm for women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087699/).  \n\n* [**Arousal is not synonymous with consent**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-013-0225-7). For one, there are common misconceptions that [an erect penis](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1097184x08322632) or [erect nipples](https://my3.my.umbc.edu/groups/archive/discussions/8342) necessarily signify sexual arousal. It's also possible for someone to be aroused [and still not want to have sex](https://web.archive.org/web/20071218060334id_/http://www.sexscience.org/uploads/media/Peterson.pdf). Women [often have a physiological sexual response to sexual stimuli that is independent of desire, and that may serve a protective effect against injury from unwanted sex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2811244/).  Misperception of sexual interest [may increase risk of sexually coercive or aggressive behavior](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/sites/psychology.uiowa.edu/files/groups/treat/files/Treat%20et%20al_,%202016.pdf), and [studies consistently show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Consent) men perceive women's actions to be more sexual than the woman intends ([93% have misperceived sexual interest on at least one occassion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730390/), though [most correct their understanding *before* engaging in nonconsensual sexual contact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455931/)). Men who date women are less likely to accurately label sexual assault [when the victim's interest is even a little ambiguous](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5756135/). If the victim has an [orgasm, that does not retroactively mean the sex was agreed to](https://sapac.umich.edu/article/52). Relatedly, one of the most common reasons [women fake orgasms is to end unwanted sexual encounters](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1363460716649338?journalCode=sexa). Sex with an aroused person who [hasn't consented is still sexual assault](https://www.rainn.org/articles/sexual-assault).  \n\n* [**Consenting to engage in some sexual activity does not imply consent for further sexual activity**](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent). The kinds of sexual behaviors one finds appealing is [highly individualistic](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181198). The law is clear that [one may consent to one form of sexual contact without providing blanket future consent to all sexual contact](https://med.virginia.edu/biomedical-ethics/wp-content/uploads/sites/129/2021/09/Rape-Adjacent-Nonconsensual-Condom-Removal.pdf), yet most sexual assaults [happen during a hookup when a man forces a higher level of sexual intimacy than the woman consented to](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17202573/). Most women [do not achieve orgasm during one-night stands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5325674/), and are [less likely to want to engage in intercourse as part of a hookup](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3262661/). \n\n* [**Physical resistance is not required on the part of the victim to demonstrate lack of consent**](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape), [nor does the law require evidence of injury](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/R-v-Heard.php) in order for consent to be deemed absent.

Contrary to popular belief, [alcohol is not an aphrodisiac.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652650) (in fact, [sober sex tends to be more wanted and enjoyable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652650)). [Most college sexual assaults occur when the victim is incapacitated due to intoxication or sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29294944).

Intoxicated men who are attracted to a woman are particularly likely to [focus their attention on signs of sexual interest and miss or discount signs of disinterest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730390/). Intoxicated predators will also often [pick out victims they know to be impaired by drugs or (usually) alcohol and make them have sex even when they know them to be unwilling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455931/). If intoxication were a legally defensible excuse, rapists would just have to drink heavily (or claim they were drinking heavily) to get away with rape. \n\n* [**Wearing someone down by repeatedly asking for sex until they \"consent\" to sex is a form of coercion**. Some forms of coercion are also illegal in some jurisdictions](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf). Genuine consent [must](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Wisconsin&group=9) be [freely given](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Minnesota&group=9)\n\n* [**Silence is not consent**](https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/sexual-assault). [Fighting, fleeing, and **freezing**](https://www.utoledo.edu/studentaffairs/counseling/anxietytoolbox/fightflightfreeze.html) are common fear responses, and thus not signs of consent. In fact, [most rape victims freeze in fear in response to unwanted sexual contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological), even though [most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape). \n\n* **[It is necessary to obtain consent from men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919322)**, too, as [men are not in a constant state of agreement to sex](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1097184X08322632). \n\n* **Consent must happen *before* sexual contact is made**, or a violation has already occurred. [Legally](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=utah&group=9), sexual contact that takes a person [by surprise](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=New%20Hampshire&group=9) deprives them [of the opportunity](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=Rhode%20Island&group=9) to [communicate nonconsent](https://www.rainn.org/laws-your-state-montana). There is [often a long period of uncertainty described in victim's rape accounts where she felt shocked by the rapist’s behavior and unsure of what was transpiring](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1471-6402.00030). In fact, [most unwanted fondling, and many rapes, occur because the victim didn't have time to stop it before it happened](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17202573/). Most victims also [become compliant during an assault, which is a protective behavior that does not signify consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#Emotional_and_psychological). \n\n* **Consent is [ethically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-consensual_condom_removal#Legal_and_ethical_concerns) and [legally](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rape-condom-sex-worker-unprotected-lee-hogben-guilty-bournemouth-a8884726.html) required [before removing a condom](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/man-s-refusal-to-wear-condom-after-agreeing-to-cancels-out-consent-judge-1.4492602)**. [STIs are on the rise](https://www.axios.com/2022/09/20/std-increase-prevention-cdc), many people are [unaware they have an STI they can transmit to a partner, there is an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhea on the rise that could literally be fatal](https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/arg/default.htm), there is [no reliable HPV test for men](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-and-men.htm), and [herpes might cause Alzheimer's](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00324/full). It's simply intolerable in a civilized society to knowingly expose someone to those risks without their knowledge or consent. \n\n* [**The NISVS includes using lies or false promises to obtain sex in their definition of sexual coercion**](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf). For example, [pretending to be someone's S.O., pretending to be a celebrity, lying about relationship status or relationship potential are all forms of sexual coercion that cross the line](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mysteries-love/201712/rape-deception).\n\n* [**Consent is at least as important (and just as required) in BDSM relationships**](http://www.nspb.net/index.php/nspb/article/view/180). It's true that [sexual fantasies involving dominance and/or submissions are somewhat common](https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Joyal-et-al.-2014-What-Exactly-Is-an-Unusual-Sexual-Fantasy.pdf); however, even 'rape fantasies' (which would more accurately be called \"ravishment play,\" since [no one *actually* wants to get raped](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498609551298)) must be carried out [within the context of mutually agreed-upon terms](http://www.nspb.net/index.php/nspb/article/view/180). It's never reasonable to assume that a particular person A) wants to be dominated B) by a particular person C) at a particular time. Sexually dominating a kinky person who hasn't consented is still sexual assault. \n\n* ***Affirmative consent* is generally required on college campuses, (and a growing number of legal jurisdictions)**. For examples, have a look at [Yale's sexual misconduct examples](https://smr.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Sexual-Misconduct-Scenarios.pdf), [Purdue's consent policy](https://www.purdue.edu/policies/ethics/iiic1.html#definitions), [Michigan's](https://nmu.edu/titleix/what-consent), [Harvard's](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rorygerberg/files/WH_task_force_comments_2014april.pdf), [Stanford's](https://equity.stanford.edu/sexual-violence-support/policies/key-definitions#consent), [Wisconsin's](https://compliance.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/03/Handouts_English.pdf), [Minnesota's](https://policy.umn.edu/hr/sexharassassault), [Wyoming's](http://www.uwyo.edu/reportit/learn-more/consent.html), [Indiana's](https://policies.iu.edu/policies/ua-03-discrimination-harassment-and-sexual-misconduct/archived-8252016-01012017.html#definitions), or [Arkansas'](https://titleix.uark.edu/definitions/index.php) university policies on sexual consent (or [California's](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/policy-crime-definitions.cfm?state=California&group=9), [Canada's](https://www.leaf.ca/news/the-law-of-consent-in-sexual-assault/), [Spain's](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/spanish-parliament-approves-only-yes-means-yes-consent-bill), [Sweden's](https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-05-26/swedens-new-law-affirmative-consent-hailed-questions-remain), etc.). A requirement for affirmative permission [reflects the contract-like nature of the sexual agreement; the partners must actively negotiate to change the conditions of a joint enterprise, rather than proceed unilaterally until they meet resistance.](https://med.virginia.edu/biomedical-ethics/wp-content/uploads/sites/129/2021/09/Rape-Adjacent-Nonconsensual-Condom-Removal.pdf) Logically, it makes much more sense for a person who wishes to initiate sexual activity to get explicit permission for the particular sexual activity they would like to engage in, rather than the receiving party having to preemptively say \"no\" to the endless list of possible sexual acts.\n\nhttps://rainn.org/get-informed/prevention/prevention-tips-for-students/\n\n"
